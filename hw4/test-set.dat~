1982	1	Delicious!!! We came here on our first wedding anniversary. My husband ordered the leg of lamb and I ordered the roast chicken. He declared it was the best lamb he has ever tasted and I said the same about the chicken. He also loved the wine but was disappointed that he couldn't purchase a bottle anywhere because it was made especially for Bouchon. We also had the mussel appetizer which was steamed and served cold with 2 sauces. So simple yet SO delicious. Didn't have room for dessert though. We live in SF so we will definitely be visiting Napa's Bouchon when we get the chance! Service was very attentive. The only thing I was bummed out about was that a large party of adults allowed their kids to play all over the place. They caused a ruckus and were running and rolling all over the floor behind us. Parents didn't say anything and I thought that was really rude of them.
1830	1	Well let's start with the service. Tamara was our server and we would like to give her 10 stars. The biscuits and eggs were also a 10. They have so many people working everything is do smooth. Packed house but a short wait. Best breakfast place in Vegas. We will be back!
479	0	Service was terrible, the meat service took awhile before they come to your table. I didn't see the waiter until I had been sitting there at least 10 minutes. Water took another 5 minutes to show up. For a $50 price tab I feel robbed. They wouldn't even accept the $5 off from the yelp app.  I'll never go to this pretend Brazilian steakhouse again.
582	1	Probably my favorite pizza in all of Sin City. Secret Pizza is great, and it's not just because the pizza is stellar. The staff is nice and there's always some entertainment in the form of drunken twenty somethings if you're into people watching. Try the white pizza...it's life changing.
620	0	I gave the MGM Grand Hotel 4 stars in my review for them. Too bad their buffet wasn't on the same par. If Charles Barkley ate here, he probably would have said that the food was "turrable...absolutely turrable!" I understand that food (and just about everything else) in Vegas is overpriced, but if I'm gonna pay $20 for a lunch buffet, I would expect better. I did like the fresh fruit they had, but everything else was just...meh. I don't consider myself as someone who's hard to please, but damn, they've got to step their game up here.
363	0	My wife and I enjoyed the one in New York so we wanted to try this one. The wait was only 20 minutes so it wasn't bad. We have two young boys so we asked if we can have a booth but the hostess said that she didn't have a server. But right after she sat us, she sat three parties into the booths. WTF!? The server that was serving is also serving the booths.  Our food order came out after the two parties that were behind us. My wife ordered the Chinese chicken salad and we got the kids sliders. The food was blah. I probably will not come back.
180	1	I was here twice in one week during a convention, the second time was greated with a welcome back, nice ot have you again.  The service was perfect, not in my face but not ignored and my water glass was never more than 1/2 empty.  As a grey haired woman of a certain age, I am honestly not used to be treated with such respect and courtesy.  And, of course, the food was great, especially the smoked beef tartare, which was outstanding.  I was also impressed with the wine recommendations.   I must compliment Mr. Teresi for his oustanding staff
156	0	What a disappointment! The food at our local hospital cafeteria is so much better! The "prime rib" was steamed. The turkey breast dry. The salads were messy. The sushi rolls tasted "off". And to add insult to injury we were seated in kiddie land. Why? We had no children with us. And we were seated where all the children (I counted 12, with different families/tables, under the age of 5) were going ultra sonic. There were plenty of tables available elsewhere. We pointed this out to the hostess who pointed to a table....2 feet away. Duh. Very annoying experience. This buffet was much better in 2004.
51	1	I've been going to the Shake Shack for years in Philly and NYC, and being on the West Coast now, I was so excited to see the beloved establishment in Vegas. I was in Vegas for 5 days, I went to the Shake Shack 5 times. - I always go for the Double Shack Burger - the beef is super moist, seasoned, tasty. The cheese is delicious as well. - Crinkle cut fries - get them with cheese on it! - Concretes are solid as well. Be prepared for a quality, delicious burger here. The only drawback is I wish it were bigger!
795	1	I love love this place.  This is must go to whenever Im in Vegas. I have had the Kiki burger and bahn mi burger. I got them protein style.  They were both delicious and fresh.  Their sweet potato fries and sauce it comes with is really good too. I cant wait til they open up in Santa Monica!
1100	1	The wait was like an hour long. This place was packed. The good thing about it was that they'll text you when your table is ready. So you can walk around the Miracle Mile shops until your table is ready.  After finally getting a seat, I really liked the design of the place. The tables were all set up really nicely (the two seaters all in the middle). Gordon Ramsey's picture on the wall though was kind of over the top (at least that's what I thought). No need to promote yourself, we're already in your restaurant. Promote the food.  I don't remember what burger I got, but it was pretty good. I remember I kept thinking so that's what a "gourmet" burger looks like and taste like. It was a bit pricey but not too much. We also ordered fries. Please note you can order 1 fries for 2 people as 1 order will be enough. It comes with 2 dipping sauces I believe.  When I'm in Vegas and I'm not eating at one of the buffets, I'd probably come eat here again.
1026	0	We came here to watch the playoffs. I made a reservation since I knew it was going to be busy. I knew everyone will be looking for a table to watch the games. The host told me not to worry and that my table will be ready. When I got there, I didn't get my table and we had to wait for the upstairs to open. This bar was not ready to host any big games. The bartender that served my margarita didn't make it right. So easy to mess up a margarita..  Food was ok. Regular bar food. They were not very accommodating especially when you have reservations. The hostess just sat everyone that walked in. She had no clue about playoffs Sunday. I should've just watched the games at the sports book in a casino. Atleast they give out free drinks!
1630	0	There is nothing special about this place. Read the Yelp Reviews and trust them! Do not come here! Harold and Kumar promoted this place like no other so everyone had to come try them, I was one of those people.  The sliders are worse than the ones sold in the frozen foods section. It is small and will fit into the size of your palm. The bread was slightly warm and soggy. The patty was dry. The small pickle was lying naked alongside small speckles of onions. It was not tasty at all. I had to squeeze a full bag of ketchup on it to give it life. For a dollar something each, I would rather walk myself to a McDonalds and order something off the dollar menu.  My boyfriend and I decided to come here because it was 5am and he was starving. Shake Shack and Rasising Canes were both closed so White Castle it was. The next morning, my boyfriend and I woke up with bad tummyaches. Luckily, our hotel had two bathrooms....
652	0	If you are coming to Vegas as a tourist...please please please do not go to Tao.  You are wasting your time and money.  The food is worse than PF Chang's and probably borderlines with Panda Express.  If you eat dinner in the restaurant they still make you leave the property and re-enter to go into the nightclub and pay full cover.  Once inside the club, it's just horrible music and bouncer telling you that you can't stand or walk anywhere.  It's disgustingly crowded and the staff treats you like crap.  So many better restaurants and nightclub on the strip to choose from.  This place is just living off their name...
1	1	yeah all the hype.  all the fuss.  all the food.  all the shakes.  delicious.  I had the hotdog and chicago dog and they were good.  now the coffee fair trade shake, i could not get enough.oh did I mention the coffee shake was delicious?    If you know what you want, there is a virtually no line window outside to get small things like drinks and cements.
264	1	My families experience at Bouchon was AMAZING! Getting to the restaurant was a bit tricky, just remember there's an elevator that takes you to Bouchon in the lobby of the parking garage! Venetian has a sign leading you to the Bouchon cafe but the full restaurant is on the 10th floor...there was a couple in front of us that messed up EXACTLY like us so I didn't feel as dumb "p we arrived at the restaurant and were seated within 5 minutes. My son (1.5), daughter (4), husband and myself got sat at a 4 top and the hostess brought crayons and pages for them to color. But we realized they cover their tables in paper!!! My babies loved drawing on the table!   Our server wasn't anything special. She didn't ignore my kids and I appreciated that. We ordered orange juice and: French TOAST - HOLY COW!!! This was the best french toast EVER. You can not have breakfast at Bouchon without ordering this!! The butter it was served with i could have ate with a spoon! Steak sandwich - the bread was perfect, our steak was perfect medium, the peppers and onions gave a great texture contrast. I will be ordering this again for sure!! Beignets - they were ok at best... Cinnamon apple oatmeal- totally regret ordering this. It was crazy watery and had ZERO flavor. We added all the brown sugar and even 3 packets of natural sugar but still..yuck. Luckily my son ate some.  I loved the French Toast and steak sandwich so much Bouchon gets 5 stars and I deem it as one of the best breakfasts I have EVER had!! I literally can't wait to go back!!
865	0	I found out WHERE NOT TO STAY in Vegas.  I expect a mistake or two and don't usually complain about anything minor but the Riviera Hotel seems to be the epitome of incompetence in the service industry.   First off, we booked a Deluxe Room with two double beds, since it was just me and my grown daughter. We had to wait in a long check-in line and the desk clerk told us and wrote down the wrong room number, so our keys didn't work.  The Bellman came up with our luggage and had to call downstairs to find out what was going on. We were supposed to have a room a few doors down. He let us in but we had to go back down 19 floors to the bell desk to get the right keys. I thought to myself, well if this is the worst thing that happens that's not too bad, even though I didn't see why they didn't bring up the keys themselves since they had screwed up.  We came here on a few days where there was record breaking heat for February.  The pool was closed the entire 3 days we were there but still got charged a $17.00 a night "Resort Fee". People were laying out in the sun in bathing suits but no one could go in the pool.  The first 24 hours:  The Deluxe two double bed room would've been fine. It wasn't too spacious, wasn't too small.  But nothing in the room worked.  I couldn't program the safe, it kept giving me an error code. I had to call security up to fix it. I have never had any problems in other hotels I've stayed with safes. Had to wait for security to fix it.  I noticed it was hot in the room and went to turn the a/c on. I saw a wrench icon blinking. The a/c was not working, had to call maintenance and have them fix it.  The TV remote didn't work most of the time, couldn't see if it needed new batteries, it was completely sealed. It would only work if you were standing about a foot away from the TV, so you couldn't even use it from the beds that it was right in front of.  Even in front of the TV the remote wouldn't work sometimes.  The WIFI only had 4 bars and would cut you off or wouldn't connect at all.  The shower drain was clogged. had to call maintenance again to unclog it.  Called the front desk to complain, They said they would upgrade us to a Deluxe One bedroom suite with two beds for free and it would be ready by 1:30 pm.  The Riviera had told me they guarantee all their rooms to be ready by 4 pm, but we spent nearly the whole day until after 4 pm waiting for the room to be "cleaned". We were starving and had to leave to eat once.  2nd & 3rd days:  Suite was nice and spacious. WIFI was non-existent, even though it showed 4 to 5 bars. One bedside lamp didn't work and curtain puller was broken. View was of the side of hotel and Circus Circus.  We had a DO NOT DISTURB sign on our door yet someone still knocked the next morning. TWICE.  We were leaving around 1 or 2 pm for the day and I called and specifically asked for maid service while we were gone.  I called Housekeeping directly, told them we would be gone but would like maid service. They said someone would be right over.  I left a tip in the gratuity envelope for the maid and placed it on the bar.  When we came back later that evening, the room hadn't been touched. Beds unmade, trash not emptied, etc.  I took the gratuity back out of the envelope and left a note that said basically "I called housekeeping and no one ever showed up so no tip for you".   One of the toilets kept running in the suite. I just got up and jiggled the handle, because it was loud. This happened a few times.  The night before we were going to leave, the safe we had been using with no problems for 2 days suddenly decided to throw up an error code with our valuables locked inside.  I had to wait for security to come up and bypass it again.  The valet and the bellmen were all nice. They received tips.  The lady at the fast food Mexican restaurant downstairs looked angry at the world and the food wasn't that great.  Wicked Vicky's was ok but too expensive for what you got.  On the day of checkout, I called the Bell Desk for help with our luggage and the bellman told me there was no one to check us out at the front desk. So I checked out over the TV system, and it said an e-mail would be sent to me. It didn't ask for an e-mail address so I assumed they meant the one they had sent 3 different confirmations to when I made the reservation.  When I returned home there was no e-mail. I called the hotel and they said they sent it to some e-mail that was close to mine but it was not right.  How is it they could send me 3 different e-mails before our arrival, yet screw up our e-mail address upon departure? I am wondering now if my credit card will be charged correctly as the charges are still "pending".  I can live with a few inconveniences, I do all the time.  I was sad to be leaving Vegas but happy to leave the Riviera, which is something I have never felt leaving a hotel (or motel) before.  They need some renovation and new management.  Poor service overall. Unapologetic about it too.
1826	1	Honestly, I didn't expect much from the generic name, but I was blown away after the first bite. You can taste the difference and can tell they put a lot of love into preparing their burger. Very high quality ingredients and they even serve beer to boot! I'm sold.!
213	0	Sat down as a party of 11.  I understand the service is going to be sluggish for such a large party, but we waited about half an hour before they took our order. Waited another 45 minutes before our food got here only to eat the worst lobster Mac and cheese I've ever had in my life. Sun dried tomatoes overpowered the rest of the flavors, and the lobster that was peppered here and there was slightly dry. The cheese was watery and reminiscent of Kraft's cheese mix. I ended up mostly mooching off of my friend's buttermilk pancakes which were 14.50 and basically IHOP pancakes (they were solid pancakes, but 14.50?). Portobello burger was also disappointing. So many regrets. So. Many. Regrets.
918	0	Stayed at the MGM grand hotel in a "suite" this weekend for a Bachelorette party. Upon arrival the parking situation was extremely confusing "self-parking" where you pay and "valet" where you pay. I called the front desk and the guest service coordinator let me know that guests of the hotel now have to pay to park EACH DAY. She claimed that this is a 4 month old policy so it was not stated when I booked the hotel. This is outrageous to me especially since I paid $400 a night for the room. You should be able to get it validated if you eat at their hotel restaurant, but the front desk assured me there was no way to get it validated. We checked-in relatively quickly but was never told when check out would be or not given any details about the Wet Republic pool party. When we arrived in our room, we noticed that it was much smaller than the pictures made it seem and we were suppose to have TWO beds, but were given just one. I called guest service once again and was told they only had ONE suite with two beds and it was booked... there was nothing they could do for me. I had to call several times again to retrieve information about check-out and Wet Republic. The guest service customer service is either A+ or horrible - no in between. For the amount of money you spend here, its NOT worth it. I have stayed at the Pink Flamingo for much less and had MUCH better customer service. I will not be spending money here again for future bachelorette parties.
1685	0	Located in the back of the Mirage, close to Samba, this is a fairly spacious buffet. They also have a to-go option: $16 for a box.  BF wanted something fairly quick and everything else in the casino would've had a long wait. Came on a Sunday (3/1/2015) around 11AM and there was no line (that should've been our first indicator about this place).  Note: Drinks are SELF-SERVE!! So if you're going to pre-tip at the cashier, I wouldn't tip very much since they hardly stop by to clear the tables or re-fill any alcoholic beverages you may have ordered.  Beer, Wine & Mimosas included during brunch.  Waffles were soggy but the french toast was pretty good (lots of cinnamon). There's a chef station that does custom omelettes but the line was too long. There's also different pizzas next to the chef station if you want pizza for brunch.  Tried the potsticker and seafood bun. The bun was really gross and mushy, but the filling was ok. Potsticker tasted like the frozen kind. Fried wonton was mostly oil and almost no filling.  The chilled shrimp and king crab legs were decent. The cioppino was probably the tastiest thing there but the bread that supposed to go with it was very stale (avoid it). Stayed away from all the sushi and sashimi since they all looked old and rubbery.  There's a carving station where the carver kind of creeped me out. He kept staring at me while he was cutting the prime rib that I ordered -_-|| The meat was fairly tender and juicy, but not much flavor.  The desserts didn't look too appealing: very dry-looking. The creme brulee tasted boxed and the panna cotta tasted like a pudding cup. I found it very weird that the "sorbet" is dispensed out of a soft serve machine. The toppings are around the corner of the machine.  Service is pretty much non-existent which sucks since my BF gave a good pre-tip. Lucky we were seated at a 4 person table even though we were only a pair because we just left our dirty dishes on the empty table (which got piled high). If you want a refill on your mimosas or beer, just get up and go to the counter yourself (otherwise you'll never get another drink).  If you have a voucher or a discount to come here, try it out.. But do NOT come here if you have to pay full price. Definitely not worth it at all. Our friends had a free voucher and they thought the buffet was really bad. Imagine how we felt since we paid for ours =/
83	1	One of the best New York style pizzas I've ever had. This place really is a secret in that it's probably impossible to find unless you ask someone. It's down this remote corridor with no signage or anything. There was also a bit of a line, but boy the pizza was worth every minute of the wait.  The slices are a decent size and the flavor is awesome. the crust is beautifully crispy. I would eat the crust by itself as a loaf of bread. That's the secret to an awesome pizza in the first place. Add to that flavorful fresh ingredients and you have a winner.  Just an FYI - don't expect a restaurant type setting. There are a couple of bar stools, but basically it's a take it to go type of place. Again, the win is in the food itself. Really good.  I highly recommend Secret Pizza to anyone visiting the Vegas Strip.
1515	1	One of my favorite places we are in Vegas! The bread they give out is great. I got a salad and my fianc got Beef Wellington. We split butter cake for dessert. Everything was delicious and the price was great for the amount of food you get. Next time we are in Vegas, we'll definitely be back!
1437	0	This place it just O.K.  There was a wait to get in and when we got seated we got the high bar stool chairs and after an hour my feet fell asleep.    The service was TERRIBLE.  The waitress was difficult to find.  My boyfriend never had his drink refilled.  The food was below average but the prices were NOT.  I had a super huge Margarita that was great though and that was the only redeeming thing about the place.  Still it has a good location on the strip...but if you are looking for quality food...keep walking.
235	0	Like much in Vegas, pretty on the outside, but no substance.  Ate here twice on a recent business trip. The space, redecorated from its previous goofy pseudo-diner style, is quite nice, masculine and casual yet well-appointed, with a classy bar and the now-ubiquitious but still pretty old style light bulbs. Sat at the bar and had friendly and attentive service.   The breakfast was standard - eggs/toast/sausage/potatoes were like "diner plus" with a flavorful pepper mixed in with the potatoes and thick texas style toast. Fine. The major disappointment was dinner. I went in craving something just barely healthy (after a few days in Vegas I was desperate for a vegetable) and the main recommended entree at Citizens is a chicken/brocolli/potato plate that looked great. Unfortunately the execution was inexcusably poor, especially for a "signature" dish. The chicken was flavorless and dry, even with the skin left on. Broccoli rabe was undercooked and also flavorless, and the potato quarters were the least cooked of all, with a full half of them too hard to even cut with a fork, and inedible. Everything sat in a plate full of broth, perhaps that's in an attempt to disguize the dryness and blandless of the food, but even the broth doesn't help. Chow in San Francisco does this chicken/brussel sprouts/mashed potato dish that's just bursting with flavor and juiciness, and it's like 12 bucks. This $25 plate was just sad and pointless. Again, like so much in Vegas in general, it's an opportunity to spend twice as much on something half as good.
685	1	Another success for Thomas Keller.  Located on the quieter back side of the Venetian, this large French restaurant is great for lunch or dinner, but the best for Sunday brunch.  It gets busy quick so either come early or be prepared to wait.   There is fresh seafood that greets you behind the host's platform.  I suggest a dozen oysters and a spicy bloody mary to get things started.  Almost everything on the menu is delicious, and they always have a few specials including an omlette/egg dish.  If you have room at the end, have some french press coffee and the beignets.  This is my recipe for happiness.  Oh yeah, finish by waddling back to your room, having some afternoon nookie (optional), and then taking a fat ass nap.  Life is good.
1649	1	Booked on New Years Eve.  One of the best meals I have had.  Everything was perfectly cooked.  The Waygu steak and the lobster was TDF.  No complaints.  Service was impeccable.  Was unable to make it here last time I was in Vegas.  But, I do plan to make sure next time I am in Vegas to make reservations.
893	1	"I'm so glad we did this, baby," are the words my husband said as we were leaving the Paris after celebrating our anniversary here. We did not order appetizers but we enjoyed the variety of breads offered to us. The wine selection is significant and they can make any cocktail you would like. My husband had the Beef Wellington and I had the bone-in rib eye. Both were cooked to perfection. I ordered my steak medium plus. It was very tender and perfectly seasoned. I think it's the best steak I've had!The beef Wellington comes medium rare and can be cut with a butter knife! It definitely exceeded our expectations. The fingerling potatoes were a bit garlicky but the Mac and Cheese was excellent. We ordered coffee with desert and that was an event! The coffee is made with a French press and comes with "ABC" spoons. The spoons are covered in chocolate and each contains a liquor ... Amaretto, Baileys, and a Cordial (raspberry). We had to try the Sticky Toffee Pudding cake and brown butter ice cream after reading the reviews. All I can say is "Wow!!" It was delicious!! This can definitely be shared. Our server was Lomberto and Ryan was helping. They were extremely attentive! Whatever we wanted, Lomberto would make it happen. He really helped to make this a memorable experience.  I highly recommend Gordon Ramsey Steak if you're in Vegas. If you're local ... You gotta give it a try!!
1706	0	Went for breakfast - I remember this place being much better several years ago. Waiter was kinda a dick (until I tipped him!), the food was mostly cold (I'd say over 60% of the food was at room temperature). The bonus - no wait. Blackberries are good.
100	0	I had the worst experience ever in a las Vegas hotel! Being a local on a Thursday night I decided to try westin They serve until 6 am and I  figured it was a great place to grab a late night dinner. As I get to the bar, nobody takes my order. I struggled To get the bartenders attention, whn I did he tells me that he can't serve me and that he has been directed to call security. So I politely asked if I could speak to security. When security shows up he refused to speak to me or even look at me. He also says he can't help me, so sitting here baffled I ask to speak to a higher management. So security manager Dean comes over and again can't give me an explanation of why I can't be served all while looking me from top to bottom making me assume that he is profiling me. After I ask the reason behind this he says he cannot tell me the reason but that he as the right to refuse service. He said i am more than welcome to come back to speak to Ben noble at 9am.
808	1	I ate here with my family.   Apps: We shared the chicken lime mango salad and buffalo chicken rolls. Both were amazing! Portions were huge.  Entrees: for my entree i had the pasta telephono which was good. But the gnocchi were AMAZING! Possibly the best pasta dish I have ever had.   Service: Our waitress was very nice and informative even suggesting menu items that turned out to be fantastic!  OVERALL: food- 4.5 service- 5 total- 4.75 rounds up! (QUICK, RELATIVELY CHEAP, GOOD SERVICE AND EXCELLENT FOOD)
1190	1	Service: No complaints! Server was very nice and attentive!  Atmosphere: Contemporary and nice! There is this neat sign near the entrance that lights up with fire   Food: One of the BEST places on the strip for a burger. My favorite is the Euro Burger. Their shakes are also very good. Be careful though the shake and burger combo is too filling for most. I suggest sharing your shake with another person.  Price: Reasonable. Around $15 for a burger. Unlike some other places, you do have to order fries separately (which runs around $8 to $13)   Overall: Highly Recommend!
292	0	One of the worst Westins I've stayed in. Rooms were noisy, dirty (bathroom floor), mold and mildew in shower, cigarette burns on carpet (non smoking floor). No flat screen TVs. Small rooms. About the only good thing I can say about this hotel is that the location is decent and they have great beds/linen.
483	0	Oh my, was so insanely disgusting.  I was stupid enough to bring my kids and they had to listen to a lady, if you can call her that, yell and cuss all afternoon.  I asked the employees about what they would do with her and they acted like they had no idea what I was talking about.  The over $25 per day resort fee was just astounding.  Paying for what?  Not to use their pool?  Was just filthy and gross.  Hard beds, nasty bathroom.  Like a pedophiles paradise.  I may be scarred for life, as will my kids.  I feel robbed.
1853	1	Three of us came here after a night of partying in Vegas.  One of my friends found Egg & I on yelp, so we tried it out.  I had the chicken fried steak. My gf had a stuffed French toast with ham and my friend had an omelette.  Everything tasted perfect!  I would highly recommend this place, and we will definitely come back, the next time we are in Vegas!
1107	0	This place was a joke, we went there after making a reservation that they would not honor.  After 2 hours in the line, they approved us to get inside.  So was it worth the wait, no way. The place was packed so much that we couldn't even move once we got in.  Got pushed around, one drunk guy even picked a fight with me since we got pushed over him.  The bounders sided the other guy coz it looked like he had paid more money to get a table (can run upwards of 5k on weekends).   All in all, an experience I just want to forget.  There are much better clubs in Vegas, avoid this at all costs.. or rather unless you cough up 5 grand.
471	0	For those who wanna try the noodles here, the sauce is good, above the average, but sadly the noodle worth only one star, it claims that it was hand pulled noodles, but it's not, or pulled by a bad chef, too soft, maybe I will consider it when I am 120 years old.
717	0	It is as if someone wanted to bring the Laughlin experience to the Las Vegas Strip. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet. However, for $250 a night, I would like a place with restrooms somewhere near the restaurants. A hundred small things make this a "never to repeat" adventure.
308	0	The movie "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle" was the only reason I wanted to eat White Castle.I waited 11 years to go to White Castle, 11 FREAKING YEARS!!! And I wish I didn't go, totally killed the joy of the movie for me. The sliders are whatever but i guess only good points was the restaurant is still new(ish) and service was great. You want a better burger go find an In'nOut or even Shake Shack which is 10x better.
409	0	Get ready to pay. The food is alright, for some big portions. And I enjoyed it all. But, really, this diner type food is overpriced. I guess you're in Vegas, and you have to be expected to loosen up the purse strings. But you can make the same counter argument because you're in Vegas too.   Saving grace = frozen hot chocolate. This is what they're famous. So it better be orgasmic, right? And oh was it. I could've easily passed up on dinner and just had the Oreo Frozen Hot Chocolate for the night. So yum yum! Come here for desert for sure!
1235	1	What a great place! Came here last night with a group of 8. The waitress split our bill for us didn't seem too thrilled about it but dealt with it. I ordered the Bulgogi burger and it was probably the best burger ive ever had. Juicy, spicy, sweet delicious. Had a fried egg and kimchee on it. Weird but definitely worth it. Also an order of onion rings. Although pricy when they came out there was a huge plate of them and they were perfectly crisp and totally yummy.  Others had plain burgers, salad, Philly cheese steak spring rolls. Everyone left happy and full. Oh, did I mention milkshakes?
1889	1	Went with some friends who were visiting and I was really excited to try this place. It was definitely a vegas bucket list for me. The space is hidden on the 10th floor of the Venetian and it's kind of hard to find. The restaurant I think is a beautiful open space with a classic French design. The menu isn't too expansive. It's small and the way it's organized can be a little confusing.   We started off with mimosas, escargot, froie grois pate, and the small seafood platter as appetizers. They also served is complimentary bread with the most delicious butter and blackberry jam combination. I loved the escargots . It can with a puff pastry on top to soak up the garlicky oil goodness. I even dipped extra bread in that sauce. The texture of the escargot and flavor was on point. The froie was good but it's was really hard. Like a spoon can stand upright in it. I definitely like the taste of a actual froie filet better but texture of this was good. I give it 3/5 stars.   The seafood platter was a beauty. We couldn't stop snapping pics of it. The lobster is flavored and it was delicious. The texture was a little chewy. The shrimp was also plump and fresh but it would have been "crispier" if you know what I mean. The oysters were delicious!  Both kinds were. Sweet and fresh. Loved them. The mussels were ok. Could have passed on that.  We didn't get our mimosas until after the appetizers and the waitress felt so bad she gave it to us on the house. That was such a sweet gesture. I love it when restaurants comp things for you when service isn't just right.   For main dishes we got the croquet Madame, the salmon plate, the burger and the steak hash which was the special. The croque Madame is so rich and buttery and gluttonous. I don't think I can eat all of that but my friends did. We also upgraded to truffle fries and that was an excellent idea since it was delicious and the biggest hit. I liked my salmon plate. Nothing special and it's something you can make at home though. The steak hash wasn't that great actually. For 30 bucks it tasted like the steak hash I can get at a diner.   Overall it was a great experience and the service was wonderful. Somethings in the menu are superb, some are just good ( standard but not worth the price) and yes guys this place is pricey.

1808	1	I love the Bouchon bakery. Any of the baked goods are amazing. The apple croissants are to die for, with a thick layer of baked apple goodness, and a perfect, flaky, buttery croissant underneath. The bacon scones are also delicious. I didn't actually have a meal here, but I can definitely vouch for the baked goods. Perfection.
1431	1	Yo! I'm literally mid meal and had to stop to review this before I forget! Service is excellent. Our server (Lucas) brought us free Pizza flavored popcorn, was very nice and accommodating and made great meal suggestions. The food is delicious! The Rising Sun burger is like eating sushi with Kobe beef and the Turtle Cheesecake Milkshake is the best milkshake I've ever had! (You can get it with or without booze in it) Definitely worth a visit.
1755	0	Terribly overpriced food. Service is awful. Do not go here unless you want to spend twenty bucks on a sandwich or burger that tastes like it's been stored in a freezer. If you love bad attitudes from servers and management, cheap overpriced food, and waiting forty five minutes to be seated then by all means .. This is the restaurant for you.
1133	1	after spending a night and half the morning at the palms burning tons of calories on the dance floor i figured that i needed to refuel.  earlier in the day i had been told by some people at the wynn that the best late night/early morning eats could be had here.    i am not gonna lie. at first i was a bit skeptical. after spending a few too many hours gambling at the $5 blackjack tables at circus circus the night before i happened across this place on my way back the wynn.  maybe it was the bitterness from the money i lost. maybe it was the on-setting alcohol poisoning. whatever it was, i was less than impressed.  ladies and gentlemen of yelp. i implore you. do not judge a book by its cover. because this place is a gem. i ordered nachos. (my new go to for late night eats). a platter of nachos the size of a sewer lid was placed in front of me. and they were delicious. in fact they gave me exactly what i needed: greasy, fatty, awesomeness.  i could not even finish half. i am not even joking. and the nachos were not the only large portioned meal. there were more leftovers on the table than food in our collective stomachs.   so a few tips for your next vegas visit:  1.) drink and dance until about 6 am  2.) go to the peppermill 3.) order the nachos 4.) enjoy the deliciousness  youre welcome.
334	0	Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews on this place before I came. If I did, I would have went elsewhere. This place is a TOTAL 2 star. I'll give it props for being brightly lit and decently clean. I ordered the coconut waffle, some frozen yogurt, an iced mocha coffee and little cream puffs that they make there. The coconut waffle was green....WEIRD. It didn't have much flavor at all. My iced coffee was HORRIBLE. I barely took 2 sips. The red velvet frozen yogurt tasted gross. It had a really weird flavor. I can't quite put my finger on it but it didn't taste like the red velvet yogurt I get a golden spoon.  The cream puffs were ok. They definitely needed more cream. One thing that really stood out, and not in a good way, was the loud speak system that announces when your order is ready.  I've made a rule. DONT EAT AT ANYTHING LESS THAN 4 STAR. I, again, broke my own rule. I try to be spontaneous though. I try to "live in the old days" were Yelp doesnt rule my life. And, that fails me everytime. There are so many good places to eat in Chinatown. Unfortunately, this isn't one of them.
508	1	This place was great!...its not in one of the newer and hotter hotels on the strip (Paris), butnthe food and service were spectacular. I went with all the signatures and they didint disappoint.  Beef Wellington was tender, juicy and full of flavor and for dessert we had the Toffee pudding. MAN O MAN the thought of toffee flavored pudding put me off a little bit, but damn I was wrong, it might be one of the best desserts ive ever had. The drinks,apps, and service were top notch, I really recommend a visit.
576	1	Love going to Burger Bar at Mandalay Place.  Great selection of different burgers from the buffalo patty to the Kobe along with a large selection of toppings and offerings.  I've had the American Classic many times with cheese and bacon for a nice juicy burger.  The hangover burger is great with the coleslaw topping and it definitely helps after a night of drinking as its name suggests.  Full service bar to eat when dining room is full is a plus and the friendly staff make sure the order is right every time.  The onion rings are super crispy and cooked to perfection every time.  Sometimes I'll do the fat fries that complements the burger of choice well.  Great place to watch current sports events while dining on a delicious burger.  The mini tvs located in the dining booths are a great idea and makes it feel like watching tv at home and having a meal.
1110	1	I've been to GR restaurants in US & UK and there's a reason he's one of the best and produces that way. The menu is awesome. I finally got the beef Wellington and it was divine. The sticky toffee pudding - one of the best desserts in your life. There's a reason its award winning. The service was fantastic. Also had the bone marrow and we asked for bread and it came with real English muffins that were very rich but yummy. The lobster tail was ok. Definitely a fantastic meal. Just don't gamble in that casino. Dealers are beyond rude.
933	1	Divine. This place is pure delicious breakfast magic. I came here upon the suggestions of fellow yelpers for breakfast and had one of the best meals in my life.  I had a banana nut muffin and the the egg crepe (the one with bacon and guacamole). Everything was spot on. The muffin was moist and flavorful. The crepe was a party of flavor, and the good salsa on the side was a surprising accompaniment for a breakfast place  Though the real star was the people. Service was what sort of thing you would watch in an instructional video. Everyone was nice. Waitresses chatted with customers kids, and you know you're home when you hear, "How are you doing sweetie". This place could easily turn into a must every time I get to Vegas.
57	0	If you get this worthless one for 10 bucks  It may still be a bad deal . got it for 20 from half price tickets.please find another buffet to goto.bad food.mediocre taste.reminded me a of a family run Chinese hotel.mind you Chinese options suck as well
1825	0	The beer was the best part of the experience. We were seated at a tiny two top in a corner and couldn't enjoy the fun vibe or decor. The waiter didn't tell us anything about the menu, or bother to ask if it was our first time. We ordered a few different things, and it all came at once. This wouldn't have been a problem if the plates were proportionate to our table, but needless to say the plates made us feel even more crowded. Thinking we could get past this, we were eager to eat. Unfortunately, the food was not tasty. The pozole and pork taco with pineapple were decent, but needed seasoning. The two other dishes were just kind of gross and disappointing. Meanwhile, the waiter never came back and a bus girl took my plate. She was probably trying to clear off the disaster in front of us, but didn't  even ask if I was done. In one last effort to find redemption, my husband ordered dim sum. Our mistake, he ate three of the four because he was hungry, but was again disappointed. The people next to us were also having a bad experience. We love the Cosmopolitan, but will not return to this place. I was really excited to try it out, but it definitely did not meet any expectations.
662	0	This was my third time staying at the LVH. With my company,I travel to numerous trade shows, many of which are held in Las Vegas. This hotel is very dated but always seemed to be the best option for location and proximity to the convention center. Well, this particular trip turned ugly when on the second morning of my stay I woke up, went to the restroom and when I returned to bed, there were bed bugs crawling on the pillow. I had never seen one before but a quick search on my phone confirmed their identity. I called house keeping right away and they sent up a security guard that collected the bugs in little baggies. They sent up a bell hop to carry my things to my new room in the old unrenovated tower (downgrade). The security guard said you need to wash those clothes as soon as possible in hot water. I happened to agree. I had one more night to stay at the LVH and I in NO WAY wanted to transport those nasty creatures back to my home in FL. When I got to my new room and I made a call to find out about laundry services. I was passed around to about 4 different people before someone was able to tell me if my clothes could be laundered. House keeping passed me to the Bell hop, bell hop passed me to housekeeping. To make a long story short. It was the epitome of unorganized. Aside from the security guard saying one time, "Sorry for the inconvenience". That was the only time I was apologized to. I realize accidents happen and those bugs are a problem that hotels sometimes run into but I was shocked at how management did barely the minimum. A simple call from the manager with an apology would have gone a long way. But instead no apology as well as no compensation for my troubles, not only was a charged the full amount of the room and resort fees....I was also charged for one of the keurig coffee kits (I don't even drink coffee). This hotel was a huge disappointment, I will not be staying here again. Even though it is the most convenient to the convention center, I don't think poor customer service like I experienced, should be rewarded. Unfortunately, because of the trade shows and proximity to the center, I think they get much more business than they deserve. They have given up on customer service because of guaranteed business they get from the trade shows.
816	1	YUMMMMOOOO. After clubbing at Marquee at 2am, you will be so tired and hungry! but luckily there is this random pizzeria down some random hallway! There is a long line, but its worth the wait because the pizza is sooo damn good! The pizza reminds me a of a new york pizza. Its big, thing and the crust is super crispy. Its about 3-4 dollars a slice and my oh my it is totally worth EVERY Penny! I got the pepperoni and meatball pizza, and a peppericni, bell pepper, and turkey?? slice. They were all delicious! And on top of that, I was short 50 cents on cash and the guy was nice enough to just give me the two slices for 9 dollars. THat is really good customer service :)
326	1	Eating here was the gastronomic highlight of our family Vegas trip, and Bouchon did not disappoint.    The opening bread was warm, soft, and crunchy and the butter was sweet.  For starters, we had the special pork belly and the salmon rillette.  The pork belly melted in your mouth.  The rillette was served in a jar; the waiter scooped out the clarified butter off the top that sealed in the flavor of the salmon.  It was served with some toasted bread and went well with the tableside pot of mustard that is typical of a classic French bistro.  For entrees, we enjoyed the Beef Bourguignon and the Leg of Lamb.  The Bourguignon smelled and tasted great and was fork tender.  The Leg of Lamb was sliced thin and delivered a perfect medium rare and had a delicious au jus.  For dessert, we enjoyed the three Bouchon brownies with ice cream.    Service and atmosphere were excellent.  The room had mirrors and tiled floors to remind you of Paris.  We came with our 2 daughters (ages 7 and 10) and they enjoyed the Macaroni au Gratin (mild cheese and good for the young pallet) and the Croque Madame, which had a fried egg on top of buttery toasted bread that sandwiched in tasty ham and cheese.  Overall, a great experience.  I love bistro food and always seek it out whenever I travel.  This is as close as I'll get to Thomas Keller's French Laundry or Per Se for a few years, and it lived up to my expectations.
552	0	We stopped in for a quick dessert and cup of coffee and it was anything but quick. The staff was not very friendly and the wait was simply unacceptable. 20 minutes for a piece of mediocre chocolate cake. I am willing to wait in a long line and pay extra for good service and great food, but not this. Don't waste your time and money!
1287	1	Best Thai restaurant hands down. Where do I even begin!? We arrived during dinner rush, but honestly they're probably busy at any hour since it's been featured on Food Network, among other places. It is handy that they had iPads set up to where they can text you when they're ready to seat your party. There is also a bar area and a waiting room so you don't have to wait outside. Before dinner, we grabbed beers and Thai tea to drink in the waiting room while being able to sit and relax inside. They have photos of celebrities from movie stars to Food Network shows all over their walls, and the owner of the restaurant which was also the chef, popularly walked around to tables with which seemed to be many regulars praising him and greeting him. Our table was ready and we ordered the prawns which seemed to be most popular on all of the tables, and a duck noodle. Mind you, I'm not a fan of duck but it was crisp and fried to perfection in the most perfect sauce. The prawns were huge and flavorful. We also had a steak dish that came with a small sauce that is to die for. What had me was that they offer the Laos papaya salad that not many other places do. We ordered a spice level of 10 and we were dying but it was literally perfection. Everything was extremely good. I was disappointed to find out that they were out of mango sticky rice, so we settled for a fried banana and ice cream, which tasted similar to Filipino banana lumpia, but they were cut up into small pieces for an easier family style and small portioning. Guaranteed I will visit this place every time I go to Vegas. You won't be let down!
1786	1	I'll have to admit that I'm a Thomas Keller fangirl. French Laundry and Per Se were my first two bookmarks on Yelp (#dinnergoals), and I've dined at this particular Bouchon location twice. One of the greatest French cuisine chefs in the world is actually an American who added his own American, playful flair to classic haute cuisine. Reservations are recommended.  I've yet to go for brunch but their dinner is excellent. The ambiance is fun, but intimate. They start off your meal with braided baguettes and butter. My husband and I split the salad lyonnaise and escorgot as our appetizers which were both light and flavorful. I ordered the steak frites because I was feeling basic but the matre d'htel butter on top was heavenly and the steak melted in my mouth (#noragrets). We opted to grab dessert elsewhere but I highly recommend the creme brle here! Service was friendly and attentive.  I look forward to coming back again the next time I'm in Vegas!
713	1	Had an excellent breakfast here on May 6, but definitely could not finish it! The grilled mash potatoes were outrageous and the corned beef hash had huge pieces of corn beef in it.  I really liked the industrial feel to the decor, very cute.  Service was excellent too.  We had  a bit of a wait, but only about 20 minutes and it was worth it! Excellent quality and taste!
1929	1	I had to update, because we've been back several times since my last review. They've really turned the trashy counter situation around. It's like 95% squeaky clean now, which is great. The pizza continues to be awesome. We have never had to wait for more than a few minutes. I look forward to friends coming to town because that means we get to go to Secret Pizza. Happily upgrading to five stars!
1566	1	Hands down the best pizza in the country. I was in New York just days before I came here and would say without a doubt better pizza than there. It's slightly hidden hence the name and absolutely packed late nights but well worth the line. A must try if you're in Vegas!! It looks like a little hole in the wall but seriously just try it and you're life will be changed.
1041	1	We almost didn't try this place but I am so happy we did! Possibly because I had this thought in my head that Thai food can't be much different from the many places that we already tried back home in Hawaii...or maybe it was because my friend who introduced us to some of our favorite Thai food places back home didn't care for this place much.  I am so glad that we ended up here regardless of the reasons pointing elsewhere because I really really enjoyed it. Since they are   LOCATED near the airport (South side of the strip). It was convenient and the timing was right.   FOOD - GREAT - We always order the same food items when trying a new Thai restaurant for the first time. It's basically so I can compare the taste. It's also our favorite dishes.   Egg Roll/Spring Roll - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#30s9CUJHF-BaOe0FWkX9nQ I asked for Spring Roll and he said they call it egg roll here. This confused me as I always thought that Vietnamese and Thai call theirs spring rolls but he said they don't use the rice paper wrap. Didn't matter, I enjoyed it. Rice paper wrap, egg dough..whatever... it came out hot, it was crispy and had great filling.   Pad Thai Noodle W/Chicken - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#skkyJU6psgsiM0M_AqMO9g I was very impressed with this dish. The noodles did not stick together, it was not too oily, and it had a very rich and strong peanut flavor. It also had the right amount of acidity to balance out the richness. This was one of the better pad Thai dishes that I have eaten.   Panang Curry W/Beef - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lotus-of-siam-las-vegas?select=lEMdN1ShZ1X41uUUg83JTQ#LhgLajbztEVV4jVr_ggEvQ We normally order panang curry or yellow curry but lately we been choosing panang more than yellow. Probably because panang is richer and creamier in flavor, and that is exactly what we got with this dish. They don't give a lot but you don't need a lot since this dish is packed with flavor.    Spice levels are based on a scale of 1-10 and we got level 7. This is about as high as I would like it to go here. Any higher and it would have probably killed the taste for me.   The ENVIRONMENT here was very pleasant. Although it was very crowded, we didn't feel claustrophobic because they have lots of tables and are properly spaced out. The size of this place is a pretty decent size. We were even able to bring in our stroller.   The SERVICE is good. As soon as we entered our hostess took us to a table to accommodate our stroller. A huge plus in my book. Our server also had proper knowledge and took care of us in a timely manner. I just wish he would have been a little happier but I can't dock them just on that.   The OVERALL price for the quality of food here is totally worth it. I enjoyed the entire experience and I have to give this place 5 stars.
1715	1	a must pit stop for true burger lovers! i heart the food here so much that i would marry the patty if i could. hands down the best because its reasonably priced, the burger dances in your mouth, and you leave with a huge smile. you can the reg burger for about $13 and if you hit the jackpot in vegas and want to splurge, go for the truffle burger, mmmm! my friends and i make sure we visit this spot each time we are in vegas.   for large groups, reservations are recommended. it's BUSY in there! just thinking of this place makes me hungry.
331	1	Last week, I had the choice of any reasonable place in Las Vegas for my graduation lunch. Having only had the lunch buffet before at Lotus of Siam, I decided to atone for my past errors in judgment.  I had an opportunity to read the articles all over the waiting area in the twenty minutes or so of wait time, so I learned that Lotus of Siam has been open since around 2000. Amazing. I'll bet the plaza in which they're located was also pretty rundown back then, but the quality of their food has probably not lessened and their reputation has only soared. I did my research this time and, along with some appetizer suggestions from my mom, we picked a lot of specialties and Northern Thai menu options.  The food arrived all at once after perhaps fifteen minutes. Patience is a virtue, as we were rewarded with delicious food. For starters, the tod mun plar (#7, $8.95) was a great take on a deceptively simple fish cakes with nice pickled cucumber. The nam kao tod (#14, $7.95), everybody's favorite crispy rice dish, was definitely yummy but a little too sour for my taste. Also very delicious but not suited for my palate was the yum nuah (#36A, $12.95), which is a great beef salad that's just too spicy for me and paralyzed me in fire and sweat for a few minutes. The spicy catfish with basil leaves (#85, $14.95) was a solid if small portion of sauteed fish in a basil sauce  After recovering from the yum nuah, I delved into the Northern specialties. The khao soi (#A, $9.95) was one of my favorite tastes of the meal. To call it an egg noodle curry is not nearly doing it justice, so I'll just say that you'd better order it when you get the chance. The kha nom jean nam ngyow (#G, $9.95) is a non-spicy pork and rice vermicelli dish that reminds me slightly of a certain Vietnamese dish called bun rieu, but I wouldn't have this one again as it seemed a bit boring compared to some other dishes. The last item from this part of the menu was the nam prik ong (#I, $10.95), a non-spicy dish consisting of a red chili paste and various items to dip into it. Pretty nice, possibly worthy of a repeat, but not a palate dazzler either.  I think the best item we had may have been the garlic prawns (on the chef's choice menu, $22.95). They are certainly pricey, and they are actually kinda worth it. Very crunchy, perfectly cooked, and just delicious. And even considering the modest portions of other dishes, definitely a splurge.  Having finally had items from the proper menu, I can now confidently express my opinion that Lotus of Siam deserves all of its praise. I don't know if I'd tell somebody to fly here just for one restaurant, but when you are in Las Vegas, you must make this a destination. Oh, and you'll definitely want to reserve well in advance if you choose dinner hours. Just saying.
1768	1	Best Burger in Town!    Hands down!  5 star best you can get.  If you havent had a bachi burger, you havent EVER had a Burger.  Fusion Asian and Burger, prime cuts that sizzle and light up your mouth upon entry.   This is the explosion in your mouth you are looking for in food.  lol.   This is fusion as its meant to be, surprising and tasty with a new combination and flavors you weren't expecting.    I recommend the kalbi, ronin or the bachi burger, they will be the beggining of a new love affair with burgers and fries..the fries are insane!   $8-10 burger, that delivers.  5 Star stuff here, DO NOT MISS THIS ONE..locals, if you haven't been here.  Beat it on down the Line, ASAP!    5 Star Recoomended!   Real deal legit shizzy here kiddies...  Get some!
1161	1	Loved this place... its off strip but worth the drive out here.  The crispy duck was awesome with tons of flavors and an awesome sauce.  The garlic shrimp was unique as you can eat the entire shrimp (shell and all) since they fry the shell and it melts in your mouth when you eat it!  The only cons I would say was the service was spotty at times as it took 10-15mins to even get waiter to order.  But once we did get the waiter, we had pretty good service afterwards.  The portions are smaller than average but then again what they make up for portions, they gain in flavor and quality.  I would suggest ordering 2 dishes & appetizer or 3 dishes for a party of two.  It is a little more pricier than the average thai place but well worth it!
1628	1	Got to vegas frm san diego this is the first place we came to eat...the place is clean and easy to find..the menu was wonderful..a plus for me was that there was rice...the price were good and the portions were big...are waitress karla was wonderful and very nice started are day off positive....will tell othe
1793	1	Best burger experience ive ever had so far in vegas!  When we got there me and my bf had already perused the menu all week deciding what we wanted to order so I was thrilled that the food lived up to my stupidly high expectations.   I ordered the burger sliders as an attempt to test my taste buds to see if I could tell the difference between the different kinds of meat. Long story short...I couldnt. But it was still nice to get a variety of toppings on each one so that you dont get bored. The best thing though for me was stealing some of my bfs truffle mayo (which like all the condiments/sauces comes on the side) and putting it on each of my sliders. It was sooooo goood. Now im a sucker for anything with truffle so thumbs up for that. One thing they should do is let you order some of their toppings even if you are not making your own burger. Next time I think id want to try the truffle sauce.   Bfs burger was kobe with foie grais and some other stuff. He said he couldnt really taste the quality of the kobe either. The kicker was the foie grais which they give a generous amount of. Next time he said he would just order the angus meat as long as he had the foie grais.   Even as we were leaving and throughout that weekend I could not stop thinking about those little burgerw with truffle mayo. Burger bar I will be back!
490	0	Welcome to the Old Country Buffet of the Aria. For the Aria being a five star resort, it is shocking the buffet is expensive (around $50 a person with tax) for the poor quality. Aria has many great options, sadly the Buffet at Aria is no longer one. The food is mass produced and has little attention to detail. Desserts taste as if they might be the day over left overs from the higher quality options onsite. If you are looking for a much better option- walk across the street to the Cosmo with Wicked Spoon. Aria could learn a lot from their buffet.
593	0	I know the servers are supposed to be "wise crackers" but there is a difference between being witty and being a complete ass. I can handle jokes.  When we sat down our bartender, Shane, barely even gave us the time of day. I didn't feel welcomed at all. I really felt like I was bothering him, and that is a very uncomfortable feeling.  Needless to say we didn't stay for dinner. We paid for our drinks and left. And Shane if you are still looking for your tip here it is... Don't be such a complete jack ass. How's that for a tip.
1137	0	Tao is incredibly overstuffed with pompous people. The main dance floor is far too busy to enjoy yourself. You begin sifting through bodies of people and realize that it's not worth it the effort.  I've been to other nightclubs on the Strip and I was looking forward to this place considering the hype. I was left with a boring experience.  Big frills, few thrills.
1141	1	Hubby and I are here in Vegas and coincidently Bachi Burger was featured on DDD, so we had to check it out and OMG....it is worth the drive off the strip. We had the oxtail chili fries as an appetizer. I liked them, but hubby was not impressed. He thought they were a little sweet, but they are dressed with garlic alioli that is quite tasty. I had the Bachni Burger, which was the BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD!!!  The meat was extremely flavorful and the condiments that accompanied the burger were wisely chosen and accommodated the flavor of the burger perfectly. We also had the pork sticky buns which were tasty as well. All in all, I would HIGHLY recommend.
193	1	i have been coming here for the last 8 years or so.  i first heard of LOS in a gourmet magazine article and had to try what the craze among all the food critics was all about.  from the first time i ate there till the um-teenth time, it never disappoints.  i always stop by for lunch when i'm in las vegas.  i've enjoyed almost everything i've tried here...don't forget to try some of the northern thai items...the northern style larb and pork stew is especially good.  then finish the meal off with coconut ice cream and the coconut sticky rice with fresh mangos.  N.B. if you go for lunch, do not get the buffet.  you've been warned ;-)
1835	1	Best damn pizza I've ever had!!! It's s legit secret as there is no sign advertising it and is tucked away down a small hallway. The pizza ks phenomenal, reminds me of home, greasy New York style slices. Been to Vegas twice now and have had it multiple times. Can't go wrong!
1258	0	worst Brazilian food ive ever had!! majority of meat was dry, hard, flavor less and BURNT. not charred, but burnt!!! for the price of this place i expected better food. servers were polite, but some meat cutters/servers are rude and seemingly arrogant. I went here for a prebirthday celebration and it was definitely a disappointment. Only reason for 2 stars is the salmon because it was delicious
525	1	In fairness to the restaurants I haven't tried yet, I will not come out and say that this is the best burger in Vegas, but any of the selections here are some of the best I have had. Their beef mixture is very delicious and they can actually cook a burger medium to medium rare which is often a challenge for some reason at restaurants like this.  After some of the hype died down and the wait times weren't outrageous, Bachi Burger even became a place to get a reasonably quick meal as well.

Most of the food was just standard fare with some of the Middle Eastern stuff being interesting. Unlike the Bellagio where I ate until I felt like my stomach would pop I ate very sparingly here.  The only memorable thing that happened here was my friend telling me that he wanted me to go with him to the 24 hr marriage chapel to be the witness (and take pics) so he could get hitched with his girl that nite..  while I was trying to get some lamb chops..  it seemed kinda surreal at the moment.
420	1	First time here a little of a wait but who doesn't wait in lines in Vegas? It was worth it. I wish for the double vs. the single since I was really hungry. Their fires were amazing cut fries they were crispy and had no grease at all and the taste was spot on! The service was also exceptional! The salted creamy caramel shake was a hit. Thanks for building a shake shack in LV. A must eat. Great for the entire family.
1544	0	Service was very slow! We had to wait about an hour til we get our food. We didnt order appetizers because we thought our orders were simple enough. I ordered fish and chips (it's on the specialties list) and the fish was overcooked.  Hubs ordered fish tacos.   Host was lovely. Waitress not so much. If you are hungry or pressed for time, do not come here!!
261	1	Heaven!  We had an absolutely delicious meal here for my birthday!  Here is a quick rundown of each item and our overall opinions:  1) Cheese plate- fabulous and large portions of several cheeses including cow and goat.  Served with delicious grain crackers and raw honey. 2) Foie Gras- buttery and delicious, paired with toasted baguettes. 3) Steak and Frites- Delicious cut of meat, cooked to an exact medium rare and paired with a huge side of tasty fries! 4) Roasted Chicken- Perfectly crisped skin and tender meat with a savory sauce.  5) Lemon Tart- Was rich, creamy, and very well balanced.    All of the portions are huge at Bouchon and the service is outstanding.
1331	0	115 degrees outside and a little face braced idiot with attitude tells us to wait outside. Inside looked like crap. Cheap tables all crowded together with LV worldwide destination sheep scarfing up lackluster food at ridiculous prices. The food was CRAP and overpriced beyond anything that Vegas has to offer. It's typical of Strip prices - these are all sheep and you must fleece them! They don't know that they can rent a car and eat good food in a one mile radius for 1/10 the price. I knew better but was walking in 115 degree heat and the kids needed to eat, so I drank the Kool-Aid.  $8.00 BudLight? $16.00 Chili Dog with canned Chili on top? YUP. SHEEP. Feed the sheep and steal their money. You think these morons from All Ports know what a a $1.00 Chili-Dog and an awesome American (ButtWeiser) costs? Nope. That's Vegas. The Strip lives on stupid sheep from everywhere. Sorry they stole from me in a bad situation but never again. We gave one of our chili-dogs to a homeless person eating out of the trash can...best part of my day.
102	0	I have frequented the Spice Market a number of times when I  was in Las Vegas.  Every time it was excellent probably the best in the city.  I took a party of 9 today for breakfast, spending over $180 only to find the quality had fallen off significantly.  As examples, the cheese on the cheese platter was dry and the edges curling.  The baked oatmeal was so over cooked that you could not get a serving spoon to break the  crust.  The bowl of compote at the crepe station were very unappetizing.  In fact the bananas foster with peaches resembled vomit.  I infact spoke to the manager, Keith, and his.attitude was that he could care less and did missed my comments.  Save your money and find another breakfast buffet.  This review should actually have 1star but the attitude of the waitstaff was excellent.  The only.redeeming feature of this Buffett.
1854	1	I love this place!  Yes, it's pricey, but if you want to complain, go to Mickey Ds, ok?  What I will tell you is that you don't need to upgrade to the Kobe beef, go with the Angus beef and you'll get a great burger.    They have composed burger offerings and they have the any way you want it option, which is the way I roll at The Burger Bar.  Great fries, the pass the Mickey D's test.  Don't be shy about calling an audible and going to the onion rings, they are tasty!  The selection of beers is fantastic.  The staff is awesome, they will take good care of you while you're there.  Just go there and I promise you'll have a great burger.
129	0	Avoid. Used to be good. They wont steam the crab legs for you unless you're a VIP member. Guess my $30 isn't good enough for them, yours probably isn't either. Go elsewhere, don't be left with a bad taste in your mouth. The food selections are hit and miss. Scampi, prime rib, sausage n peppers, fajitas and guacamole is ok. Bunch of other stuff not so great. Service is questionable. They only pick up dirty plates-eventually. You have to get your own drinks. No purified water, just tap.
845	1	Hey! watch out now.. cus the southwest is comin' up! Bachi Burger, MMMMM! I would end the review there.. But Bachi deserves more than that. Seriously, forget the burger truck. Bachi can stay right where it is and I'll come to them anytime. I've only been here once. Thanks to Yelp, it has led me here. But with my stomach willing and all... I would come here every day.  I came here with three others being all Bachi virgins. So we ordered a different burger each. That way we can try eachothers. The inside is fairly spacious and simple. I ordered the Bahn-Mi burger. I'm not sure what Bahn-Mi means, but I'd assume it's a vietnamese sandwich except in burger form. I got to try the ox-tail chili fries and the parmesan truffle fries. Both are deservingly tasty, but I love the parmesan truffle more. They had taro boba but no hot taro milk tea =/. What was more important was that the service was quick and friendly.
1017	0	If I had never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before, I would have still thought the service a bit slow.  However, having been to Fogo de Chao and a couple of others like it in Atlanta, I know how good it can be and this doesn't measure up.  If you are paying big money on the strip you should match or outdo anything in Atlanta, so to see this fall short is really disappointing.  Someone in Vegas set this thing up and is just going through the motions.
1509	0	This buffet is priced pretty much the same as the rest of them, and includes unlimited wine and beer. We picked this buffet because we were staying at the The Mirage, and they also had a better quality beer included in the price.  There were a lot of options for people without any dietary restrictions. Vegetarians watch out! I talked to the chef and he told me that even the dishes marked as vegetarian contain chicken powder!!! The CHEF told me this! He didn't seem to care at all that this of course makes any vegetarian items not safe for them to eat. I spent the whole night and next day sick from eating chicken, which I am allergic to. This practice of adding meat to items clearly marked as vegetarian is dangerous. Who knows what else is hiding in their food.
277	1	Wow!  Wasn't expecting such an amazing meal right as I got into Las Vegas. Always good to eat off the strip.   The meats were perfectly marinated and good cuts. Cooked at the right temperature the meat tastes were tender and flavorful.  Order the salt and sesame oil as a side!  The bulgogi bibimbap was exactly what I was looking for. We ordered the Gangam for two and extra left over. It was the best deal!  The oysters, calamari apps and sides were just that sides.   You come to a Korean BBQ house for the meat and that was phenomenal.
607	1	Yuuuuuum, this place is great! I came here during a weekday so there was no wait, but still a lot of patrons! So be careful if you're going to come here during the weekend. By the way, don't let the outside fool you. It's pretty big inside!  The food here is so flavorful! The service is uhhhhmazing and if you're Asian, you know it's rare you get good service at Asian restaurants. We started off with the tom yum soup, level 6 spicy. The spice level would definitely go up next time. It has just the right hint of hot and sour. Next we got the pad thai which totally blew me away. Pad thai is something I always need to get at a Thai restaurant to compare and this dish surprised me with how good it tasted. The papaya salad was good, but nothing really special. Garlic prawns were huge and crispy and I could taste the slightest hint of garlic! I hate it when food items claim they have garlic in it but you can't taste it for shit. Next we got the drunken noodles w/ soft shell crabs. MMMMMM, so gooood! Crabs was good and drunken noodles had the right amount of flavors. Last, we went with the mango sticky rice. The rice could be sweeter in my opinion but overall, not bad.  I love this place and would continue to come back when I'm in Vegas. Until then, I'll be dreaming about it.
122	0	This hotel like all the others need to STOP CATERING TO SMOKERS PLEASE. If you truly enjoy breathing second-hand smoke while gambling, walking through the casino/hotel, eating, etc. then this is the place for you. It was really hard for me to like this place. The rooms are average. They charge to even drink the water which is really sad. This was my last stay here.
110	1	One bite the Rising Sun Burger and you're in beef nirvana.  And one bite is all I got, because my dinner companion, AKA significant other, wouldn't share after that.  But that's ok, although my Longhorn burger wasn't as good, it's no flakeout in the burger department.  Just not as exotic an explosion in your mouth as the traditional Japanese flavors that are perfectly introduced into the western standard that is the burger on a bun called, once again, The Rising Sun.  And let me tell you, this burger planetarian will now orbit around this fabulous burger.  The beers are nice and cold and that's what I reverted to after an uber strong margarita on the rocks.  I treated it like a shot, cause at $14 there's no way I'd leave it sitting on the table.  We were seated immediately, the service was fast, extremely friendly and ready to answer any questions we had about the menu.  I can't wait to go back, and guess what I'll be ordering next time?  Hai, The Rising Sun.  Arigato Holsteins!!!
946	1	Great food, fast and friendly service. Modern upbeat decor, privatish booths.  Honey bread took over 20 minutes, but was great - order ahead.  Close to the strip, across from the hard rock hotel and Hofbruhaus house (and kiss minigolf).  No frills, would be happy to go back anytime.
1288	0	Last time I went there were choices for the cotton candy martini's.. This time the rude bartender snapped at me and said NO, there isn't. My friend and I ordered a cotton candy martini regardless. He kept saying he was busy and would attend to our order soon. I told him to take his time and he snapped and said NO I WON'T... umm ok, I was just trying to be nice and not pressure the guy.   4 drinks and crappy service later, we paid and the bartender approached my friend when she paid and said "Sorry for the lousy service". Really? Admitting to the lousy service but not doing anything to improve it. Thumbs down. I'm seriously disappointed. I won't be returning. The Sugar factory's goblets made up for the bad service and not so great drinks.   I'm disappointed :(   OH and it was my birthday.
1919	1	Let's go, let's go, let's go! Super fun, relaxed atmosphere- great place to stop by for a late lunch after an afternoon at the pools. Even better if you fit in a morning workout, because the food is even more glorious without the food-coma-associated-guilt.   Service: Attentive and very helpful  SPIKED SHAKES: Amazing. Can personally recommend Birthday Cake, Cereal Bowl, and Drunken Monkey. What's even more amazing is how good the vegan cinnamon pecan shake was.  You really can't go wrong with any of the burgers (and as far as the sides go, I'm usually a sweet potato fry fan, but their onion rings came out on top!). Our group also may have ordered a second round of the crispy pork belly buns to take home. I can't wait to go back and try a few more of the "nosh" items (small plates/apps)- poke tostadas or buffalo chicken dip, anyone?
1805	1	If you are looking for a standard burger, be warned, you will not find it here; the burgers here are upscale and Asian-fusion inspired.  This place is also a bit small, so get here early because it fills up quick.  The service here was great, and the food was even better - the pork buns we had for an appetizer were outstanding; as good or better than I've had elsewhere in Vegas.  The burger (I had the Miyagi-san) was great, although if I got it again I would leave off the fried egg. The salt & pepper garlic fries were amazing, as was garlic chili aioli that came with them (I could put that on cardboard and still enjoy it) - and just a note, the fries are big enough to share between two people.  You can tell Bachi Burger went out of their way to be a little different, and they have succeed, and impressively done it without being cheesy. If you're looking to spice up you're typical burger, you can't go wrong with Bachi Burger.
1682	0	Everything looks much better than it tastes. This place is "meh" at best. I recommend loading up on mimosas prior to braving MGM's buffet (if you're compelled to eat here like I was, because it was bundled in the price of your room.... Or if you're involved in some kind of Fear Factor dare).   Stay away from the eggs, taquitos, fish, and pretty little single-serving desserts! I'm not sure if I'll be able to get up from my chair... It feels like I consumed a hockey puck... Made of lead... Ugh...
1832	0	If you want a good buffet.... Unless you're on an insanely tight budget and just craving a buffet for the fun of variety, skip this. You'll pay double for dinner elsewhere but it will be a million times better.  On the other hand, if you're just going for a fast, four course meal: salad, soup, entree and dessert you WILL find one yummy option in each genre and be satisfied.  Most of the meats were over cooked and tough or flavorless, or both. Fried chicken was good and the chicken Marsala was too. Roast beef was "just okay", the horseradish sauce was weak sadly.  Mashed potatoes were kind of lumpy. Gravy had minimal taste. They only had one vegetable side that I saw, corn with onions???   Pasta dishes were blah but: shockingly they had *awesome breadsticks* and decent pizza.  Mexican station was nice. Nachos were pretty good with all the fixings. Well. Not all. They had no guacamole.  One major gripe: something insane happened to the guacamole (like maybe a kid put something weird in it) and they refused to put any more out even though the buffet was going to be open two more hours. The lady who pointed it out and a few other people nearby were obviously disappointed. It wasn't worth saving the $ on not putting more out to piss like 5 people off.   I skipped most cold/salad options as food born illness is usually found in uncooked food. My fianc tried the ambrosia salad and liked it and wasn't ill or anything.  The tomato bisque was like a jazzed up version of Campbell's but I liked it. Chicken soup was fairly pleasant as was the Mexican meatball soup.  Desserts. They ran out of the only thing I was interested in: pistachio Creme brle and left the sign out to torture me. Running out so early in the night seems lame. Leaving the sign up to prove it is a fail.   Some cakes were dry (I'm looking at you carrot cake) and others were plushly moist (yes you hot smores lava cake).  They had good drinks (those included in buffet), Mt dew was really fizzy and had plenty of syrup to soda water ratio. Hot chocolate and coffee was available as well as milk and Pepsi products.  Overall, I wouldn't visit again because they didn't have enough well prepared meats or variety of side dishes. However, I don't regret going because we did have plenty of food to nosh on and the smores lava cake saved me from utter dessert disappointment.
175	0	So my family went to Vegas to celebrate my daughter's birthday. Of course this is the perfect place to sing to her. I'm willing to spend $200-$300 for our family. We came in and it was 100 degree outside, we were all tired and hungry.  Then this family came and cut in, this lady ( the mom) cut in with a straight face and didn't even care cause she knows she's doing it on purpose. My husband told her husband we were in line but I said to him it's ok cause they were only party of 3 and we have 6 in our group anyway. Then I told my husband, "just be grateful your not married to that kind of woman." And the husband heard, the husband and her kid was embarrassed by that woman's attitude. People, don't embarrass your family just for a table! Anyway, so we got our table....our waitress asked what we want for a drink, I gave her our order and I said that's all and I said "That's all"....and she said, "that's all you are going to order". And I'm thinking for a drink "yes". She left and I saw her whispering to another waitress, and I'm like..... hmmmm???? Then I came close To her register and asked to sing for my daughter, so she said to order a desert, so I did and she  brought the sundae with a candle and DIDN'T even sing to my daughter.... She just left it on our table. So we just sang to my daughter, just us!!!! How RUDE!!!! Our waitress is this black lady, that looks like a unemployed stripper/semi retired prostitute. And she's also too slow!!! Then we were waiting to order, looking at their yummy looking food. And we can't understand why she's taking too long to come back. After 30 minutes she came back with a receipt!!!! WTF!!!!! There's six of us and we only ordered drinks and you thought that's all we're ordering!!!! Dumb waitress!!!! We're celebrating my daughter's birthday!!! Anyway we were so pissed that we just decided to leave. This place is understaff..... their sundae are too sweet, the frozen chocolate drink that everyone is talking about is too grainy. YuKkk!!! And they have one dumb black waitress that needs training. I can't believe I didn't check her name. The other waitress seem nice and faster. But she's just too slow and obviously this place is under staff. They overcharge people and their understaff. Ridiculous!!!! Never will I come to this place again!
188	0	the wait was long. ordered the lobster omelette and crabcake something. wow, don't even remember, that's not a good sign. I'm particular about my crabcakes. Not too much bread crumbs, that's good, but the crab was all shredded. I'm looking for lumps! Had a mimosa, that they forgot. I don't think i need to go back ;/
1895	0	Embarrassing service.   When you have food runners and bus-persons handling your tables... There is no excuse for you to be hard to reach.   We came in last night, party of 11. Our server took forever to take a drink order. Our food order. Forgot about certain questions we needed answers to. And just down right looked like she didn't give a crap about her job. No personality... Not even a smile from this girl.   She came over only once to see if our food was ok. And not to the entire table either... She came up behind one end of the table and asked with a low voice if we needed anything. Any other time.. We had to stop her from avoiding us to call her over.   Didn't seem like she was busy either. I watched her the entire time. No rush. No pep. The only table she bothered to table touch was the party of 2 in front of us!  The basic job requirement: drink refills, wasn't even done! I purposely waited to see if she would come by and offer me another iced tea. (Because I had a water to get me by) Not once. That cup had bare ice all throughout my meal.   To management: We stiffed Kimberly on a $340 tab... because she didn't deserve the tip that was suggested. She's lucky she got anything at all. I'll tell you who did earn it though, and did get it. Manuela. The bus woman who made sure we had extra small plates. Brought us limes/lemons. Refilled our drinks. Asked how we were doing on more than one occasion. You know. Things our SERVER should have been doing. Things that an ex-server like myself will notice and be annoyed. Annoyed that employees nowadays show no pride in their work.   To everyone else: there are way better restaurants in this town to go to. With better food.
502	0	I have eaten at places in Vegas that are pretty bad, but I haven't found a place that serves absolutely inedible food...until last night. The food here is HORRIBLE. I ordered the pad thai...and what do I receive? Something that resembles chinese chow fun, but tastes like plaster. It didn't even remotely taste like pad thai...or chow fun for that matter. My fiancee ordered the char shiu noodle soup. ALSO inedible. The noodles weren't even close to being fully cooked and were still HARD. The broth was sooooo salty...Morton's called them and is asking for their salt back. My friend ordered the chicken fried rice. The rice wasn't even fully steamed before frying so it tasted like pieces of gravel. I can't believe the Bellagio would allow a product like this to be sold on their property. I will never go back again. That place was complete ASS. (and expensive!)  Oh, and no refills on soda? What the hell is that???
1038	0	If I could give this place zero stars I would. My group and I were not expecting a 5 star dining experience walking into Cabo Wabo but what we weren't expecting was  to be so dissatisfied before our food even came. Our server recommended the specialty Cabo Wabo margarita because it's " made in house" and the other marg was basically a mix. So we ordered some pitchers and then some chips and salsa. When the chips and salsa and drinks came we were so hungry we dove right in. The salsa tasted like burnt cigarettes, and the margaritas were the worst I have ever had. Too sour and soooo watered down. Mind you pitchers were $45 so we were expecting something much better. We decided we didn't even want to give the food a chance (I had previously heard a table behind us talking about how horrible the food was.) We asked to cash out and got out of there as fast as we could. I will compliment the manager for only making us pay $30 for a $100 bill. Yes $100 for horrible chips/salsa and margaritas. We then headed over to HEXX which was amazing and a much better experience.
1239	1	5 star service from beginning to end.  The waiters took great care of us, helped answer all of our questions, and were incredibly knowledgeable.  You're going to pay a great deal, but it's a great meal and experience.  The steaks were cooked perfectly, the drinks were great, and the sides were amazing! Be ready to drop a great deal of money, but when you're in Vegas and with a name like Gordon Ramsay attached to it, you know what you're getting into.
1428	0	I was in live for an hour last night when finally got to cashier to make my order I got 2 regular no onion and no cheese and  10 jalapeo no cheese- none where jalapeo and all cheese - all burgers ended up in the trash - 1 AM you know I was hungry ! Lost my appetite when saw wrong order -I try to call the vegas number and no way to be transfer to manager no one picks up. Left 5 messages no one bother to call back !!  No excuse to take bad order !!  Hire none experienced young kids to work !  Bad bad and bad !
778	0	Let's just get straight to the point...  Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, but the ramen that they had there wasn't the finest I've had. It had me regretting my decision to get it and wanting the tan tan noodles that were next to me and the ceviche that was across the table. The broth was watery with some greasy in it. It was just too salty. I'll pass next time on the ramen and just get something....less complicated.
1556	1	I grabbed a salad from here for dinner four different nights during my stay at the Venetian. The staff was genuinely friendly and the prices were very reasonable for Vegas. The Grand Lux Cafe is the place to go for breakfast, lunch or dinner if you want an easy and inexpensive meal.
898	0	If you are a tourist this is probably one of the best options on the stip to go and dance latin music. However, if you are a local I would not recommended.  This restaurant/bar has two floors: the first floor has the restaurant area where you can eat next to the dance floor. They play R&B, rap and a little bit of everything. The problem is that is next to the patio so I don't think they have AC, or if they do is extremely hot!! ( I promise you I'm not on my menopause yet and I was sweaty). on the second floor, they play Latin music, the dance floor  has a decent size, but I went on a Saturday night and there was hardly anyone there.. So if you have better option, I would totally go somewhere else.
1737	1	Made an effort to try a Thomas Keller restaurant and was not disappointed at all. Highly recommended!! We had the croque madame and its one of the best I've had. The monay sauce was not overwhelming, the rich melted cheese goes well with the ham and the brioche was perfectly made. Generous portions of well cooked fries! Will definitely come back!
202	0	We decided to try Treasure Island buffet as we had received a complimentary coupon from the hotel. I was famished when we arrived, and still, the food was just about inedible. Meats tasted frozen and had very cheap, been sitting around under the heating lamps  for ages, quality to them. We found a hair on our plate. The only redeeming quality, hence two stars and not one, was the dessert bar where the items were not completely horrid and inedible. Staff was pleasant enough. Will likely never come back - free coupons or not. Stay away if you prefer food that tastes fresh and edible.
1887	1	Decided to come here on a whim with some friends for lunch, and I'm so glad we did!  We ordered the meat lover's set and a couple of noodle dishes.  The meat was delicious and tender and the spicy seafood ramen was amazing.  Will definitely be back when I'm in the area again!
982	0	Very unhappy with this buffet. They claim the "Best buffet in America". WOW, I certainly hope not.  Seafood spectacular was anything but.  4 items do make a spectacular, two of which were fried shrimp.  Up side: for $12 the food was tolerable.  DOWN SIDE: place was filthy. Food everywhere on floor, ground into the carpet - we were there for just over an hour and NO ONE cleaned the carpet even once.  Were they busy? Thursday about 6 pm, Steady business. Is this acceptable? NO. Having been in the business for over 25 yrs.- including  a busy buffet, I find this completly unacceptable. On the food line, at least 1/2 the items were empty the several times I walked the line.  All the cooks did seem to be enjoying  themselves rather than tending  to the line. The server was overwhelmed  by 28-4 tops that she was attempting to attend to by herself.  Staff training seemed to be non-existent as the busboy, when he finally showed up, seemed to have had no training at all. So: food - **; Service: Jenny- ****; Cleanliness - 0*.  I, personally will go hungry before considering this as a place to eat.
927	1	Eating here for the first time today and I love it! I go to school at UNLV and I never knew this spot was so convenient, I'll definitely be visiting more often. We ordered the Gangnam meal today and the food was brought out very quickly and the workers are very attentive and clear about their variety of food items.
562	0	We chose to go here the day after the Las Vegas marathon because Mexican is always a good day after race meal because it's filling and we are usually starving.   I know it's Vegas and all but the fact that they want you to pay $4 to start off for chips and salsa is a bit crazy especially given that it's a Mexican restaurant. We ordered margaritas and I have to say that this was the worst $13 margarita I have ever had. It tasted so sicky sweet that it was undrinkable. It was almost as if it was all simple syrup mix and no alcohol.   We ordered the steak nachos and thankfully the waitress was wise enough and kind enough to tell us that the nachos would be enough to feed both of us. Boy was she right! We are by no means gals who eat like birds and these nachos could have easily fed 3 of us. So if you want to get your money's worth definitely order the Nachos. There is a nice heaping of guacamole on the top of these which is some decent guac but they are lacking in sour cream - there's very little drizzled across it. (I asked for some extra but it never showed up.) When we asked for some salsa for the nachos we were told it would be an additional $4.  Guys you'll be happy to know that the girls are dressed in a "bad girl" theme and are all pretty attractive. Our waitress was nice enough but the service was still lacking. I'm not sure where in Vegas the other Mexican places are but there has to be something better.
1579	1	Of all the restaurants I have been to in Las Vegas, I have never been to one that so perfectly captures the essence of the Vegas Strip. The exterior of the building looks rather unassuming aside from the neon "Peppermill" sign at the front, but once you walk through those doors you are officially in Vegas. The amount of neon lights is just unreal! The 50's diner/tropical oasis combo is something I am sad to have gone my 25 year life without experiencing. There are flamingos everywhere, and their tableside sugar is rainbow colored! If all of this doesn't scream Vegas to you, then all of the hungover/still partying people dining alongside you will! This was our stop for breakfast before leaving Vegas on Sunday morning. Standard breakfast fare, but giant portions! I had the eggs bennie which was delicious! My husband had the biscuits and gravy that even a human vacuum like himself could not finish. My dad had the ham and eggs with a slice of ham bigger than his face. The wait staff was really wonderful. Very quick and helpful. Overall, I truly enjoyed dining here and cannot wait to go again!
681	0	if i can give 0 stars i would .I came to vegas to have a great time and gamble for my first time and figured hooters would be a good choice, however i was wrong! I have already been to multiple casinos to gamble for my first time and have had a great experience so far but when i went to hooters it ruined my night.First i started playing slots then decided to cash out but the machine had problems so i had to wait 15 minutes until finally i found a technician that helped me with my problem. Then i headed to the card tables to try out some blackjack and was doing pretty good when i noticed a cocktail waitress and asked her for a drink because she was helping everyone else except me . she then asked me for my id with a stuck up attitude and said she would be back soon.20 minutes go by and still nothing, so i switched to a a different table with a different waitress. As i sat down to start playing a cocktail waitress wasn't paying attention and bumped right into me and spilled 2 beers all over my pants and then laughed and felt kind of stupid so i brushed it off and helped her pick up her mess. As i finish  helping her i asked her for a beer and she told me to take seat and play a hand and she would be right back. so she waits to confirm that I'm playing a hand and then sneaks over to her manager to give a description of how i looked and said i was to drunk and says to not give me anymore drinks (which was overheard by multiple witnesses).I then wait about 20 minutes and she's nowhere to be found..I was then approached and told by an eyewitness what was said after i left the table .I immediatley approached the manager that the waitress spoke to and i was told to go speak to the bar manager .As i go over to the bar manager i see the waitress and overhear her telling another waitress that some drunk guy came and knocked all of her drinks over as i walk up to her.I immediately become pissed the **** off and ask her for her name and her manger .She then brings me to the bar manager and he asks whats going on with a annoyed look on his face , i proceed to tell him whats going on and he cuts me off and rudely says "what kind of outcome do you want from this" , as the waitress walks by and says "you can even ask everyone at the table what happened" with a smirk on her face. I then ask for his manager and he brings me to the head night manager at the customer service booth.I then proceed to tell her what has happened, he then comes back from a 30 second walk and says to his manager that everyone at the table confirmed what she has said, (as i look at the table none of the players that i played with were there!!!!!).His manager then said that theres nothing she can do about it and the bar manger then said that maybe i should get a lawyer with a laugh and walks off!I immediately left there casino and will never return.not only that but i will be contacting a lawyer tomorrow morning to pursue the slanderous comments that were said by julian with a civil lawsuit . As you can tell I'm obviously not drunk but pissed the **** off and encourage everyone to go to any other casino except this one!
1150	0	We waited almost an hour to be seated when there were only 3 groups in front of us in line. We got the shrimp wonton soup and some chowmein. I thought the food was boring. I dropped a shrimp wonton in my lap and our server, who was taking an order at the table next to us, stopped what he was doing to point and laugh at me, then finished talking to the table and didnt even stop by to offer me a napkin. When I stopped him later to ask for one he acted put out. They charged us for our tea, and it was gross. I thought the food was boring, and wayyyy overpriced. They dont even put vegetables in their chowmein.  I would have only given them one star because I hated the whole experience, but I had to add a star because my husband was happy with getting a chance to sit down and eat what he called simple food. It made him happy so they earn a star.
1779	1	First off, I'm a huge fan of Hubert Keller's TV show and had to visit Las Vegas to dine at his restaurants. Although his other restaurant Fleur (located in the same building downstairs) was somewhat disappointing, the Burger Bar served the best burgers I have ever eaten. I ordered the Hubert Keller burger the first time, and it was delicious. The sweet caramelized onion sauce that came with it was perfect, and the medium rare buffalo patty was cooked to retain the optimal moistness. My dad let me try a bite of his American Classic, also medium rare, and it tasted even better than my burger! I loved this restaurant so much I came here for lunch again days later. Unfortunately, I did not have as great of an experience. I ordered the American Classic, and also I still call for it to be medium rare, it was much dryer than before. I asked for grilled onions instead of raw onions, but they still gave me raw. I called sweet potato fries both times, but they were less crunchy the second time. The service also felt less attentive than it had during the preceding visit. With that said, the Burger Bar still remains my favorite burger place, and I would definitely return on my next visit to Las Vegas.
647	1	Came here on Monday, and 1$ shots and 1$ beer! How can you say no?! What a great place to pre-game before hitting up Marquee nightclub. And must I say their burgers are out of this world! My friend and I got the kobe beef burger and the steakhouse burger and split them. Just some excellent quality meat... The taste was great too, but it mostly comes from their meat quality, so my hat off to Holsteins. Oh, and let's not forget their crunchy shoe string fries! Yummm... Okay I'm starting to sound like a fatty so I will end it here... Next time I come, I will try the shakes!
849	1	Bumping it up to 5 stars after our last dinner.    You GOTTA try some of the dishes they got going on like the sturgeon confit!  Oh my god!  It was as if a salmon mated with a whole block of tofu and voila!  That may sound terrible to some but goddamn!  I've had plenty of sturgeon caviar but never the actual fish.  The fish was truly amazing both for texture and flavor.    Then there's the veal appetizer.  They slow cook the veal, bread it and THEN pan fry it!  What??  I'll have whatever the chef is smoking please.  Juicy, flavorful and crispy with some great cream sauce.  I would've taken this as an entree.    We also got the saffron mussels and pate which were very good but not as good as the top 2.
798	1	I loved this place. There was a 45 minute wait, but well worth it. I ate the pork stew off the northern menu. It was delicious. The place was busy, clean and the staff were very attentive. No surprise some of my favorite food network chefs had their pictures on the wall. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas
519	1	GREAT LOCAL FIND! Good place to eat. I love their drink selections, and their food. I'm a big fan of kimchee and beef so my favorite burger has to be the Kalbi burger. I also like the Ronin burger. I mean who doesn't love fried egg and katsu in their burger. Right? Their fries are awesome! I recomment the garlic parmesan fries are awesome. LOADED with flavor. Very garlicy and lost of parmesan in it if you like that. If you want to go for a softer tasting flavor for fries I'd say the sweet potatoes. Those go really well with the Kalbi burger. I also might suggest that you try at least ONE drink that isn't a coke or pepsi product. Their beverages are one of a kind, and tastey. So be brave! Try one of them. The feel of the place is very simple, hip, and urban. Easy enough. It doesn't have all the extra mumbo jumbo or glitz and glamour of the strip. So if you are looking for a casual place to eat with great service. Try it! I swear it is an experience!
584	0	What a joke of an establishment.   Rude staff. 20 minutes for a drink order. Aloof when taking order. Aloof when bringing food. Sarcastic when asking if we needed anything else.   Disgusting food. That's a tough thing for me to say because never would I say food is disgusting if it truly wasn't.   Cold fries. Who the hell serves up cold fries nowadays?!  Onion rings made out of the outer rind of the onion. You know, the first layer under the peel? Yeah that tough one that you don't eat.   Fish tacos. What a joke! Raw and cold.   Wagyu sliders. Dry like the Vegas desert. It was so bland it was comical.    Will never ever ever step foot here nor recommend it to anyone. Don't waste your time. For vegas being the home to fantastic dining, do not! For the price of this place, go to a fabulous steakhouse instead.  And to the "chefs" working that night-- shame on you! If there was an ounce of pride in what you do, it wouldn't have reflected so damn POORLY in what was served! Shame on you!
1027	1	OMG!!!  this place is the best, as soon as i found it, i came back every day i was in town!  I always get a couple slices of the White pizza, a lot of garlic, but i like that!  it is really good, thats just my opinion!  A must go to spot at the Cosmo!
1905	1	GOD, SECRET PIZZA ALWAYS HITS THE SPOT. From the very first time I stumbled upon this "secret" place to every time I've been to vegas after, this pizza spot ALWAYS delivers.   During my last vegas trip, I discovered the magic of CALLING AHEAD!!! Yes you can use any house phone and have the operator connect you to this pizza joint to order your delicious pie. All you have to do is called 35-45mins before you anticipate eating (say....call 35mins before you leave the dayclub or while you are winning big money @ the tables) and VOI-LA....you have FRESH pizza for your drunkchies.   As for which pie to order, cant go wrong with pepperoni but veterans know that the WHITE PIZZA at Secret Pizza is THE BEST!! Mozzarella, ricotta, garlic, drizzled with olive oil with NO sauce!! Thin, CRISPY and DELICIOUS!!!!!!
794	0	I would like to know if the food or service is good... I will never know.  My sons wanted chicken wings... Figured we would call ahead to see what the seating situation was like... No answer.  Looked up phone numbers for restaurant.  No answer over 2 hour period of calling at least 6 times.  Called main desk.  They asked extensive questions on when we would come, how many... I was getting tired of this and said, "I'll just place an order for carry-out."  "One moment please.  I will transfer you to the restaurant."  Still no answer.   It must be nice that business is so good on a Sunday that you cannot even pick up the phone.  I guess you don't need my money anyway.
1502	1	Not sure whre they get that different types of colored sugar in that little sugar caddy but I loved it! Breakfast was pretty awesome here and I'm glad I shared a plate with my boyfriend. We didn't even finish what we got (pancakes, fruit, eggs and bacon and sausage). I really liked the neon type of lighting and kinda dark inside style. The staff were all friendly and you can tell that locals come here to it's gotta be good (at least that's what I like to think).
1092	0	DO NOT EVER EVER EVER CONSIDER STAYING HERE! it's cheap but it needs to be closed down. One thing is saving money another is putting up with the worst when your trying to enjoy Vegas. I know you think I'll barely be in the room try taking a shower in s tub that's clogged & the water not being able to be adjusted things broken dirty smelly. Elevators hVd tagging no a/c in the hallways it's a DISASTER!! Circus circus is probably better then this and that's a Hot mess itself ! SHOP AROUND BALLYS FLAMINGO ETC .....
821	1	BEST BURGER I HAD IN A LONG TIME :)   5 stars: *prompt seating *great customer service -- our waitress kept coming back to check up on us and kept refilling our drinks without me requesting for a refill. i love that! *The meat wasn't dry! *A creative way to dress up your burger  I will call my burger "The Morning Beast burger" (don't laugh because it was GOOD) *Turkey burger *Dry whole wheat bun *Blue Cheese *Caramelized Onions *FRIED EGG!!  It was really good! The turkey burger wasn't dry at all! i know in the past  turkey burgers tend to get dry due to lack of fat but it was grill to perfection.  PS. Try the Sweet Potato fries! :)   Total bill for two people was wound $40 with drinks so it wasn't THAT bad. I rather spend a lot of money on good food :)  Have anyone tried the Truffles?! $35 each?!!
551	0	Heard the frozen hot chocolate hype so had to try one with half oreo and half mochaccino flavors.  It tasted like chocolate ice milk with whip cream and a couple coffee bean candies and some crushed oreos on top ... which is fine.... but to me the atmosphere ruined the whole experience.  The tables seemed too close together and small ... at least where we were seated (directly across from the kitchen).  It also seemed a bit on the dirty side.  There was such an overwhelming scent of ketchup in the air, it ruined my desire for anything chocolatey.  Also, I wanted to wash my hands before eating and had to go outside of the restaurant, pass the patio area, and down some cavernous cement hallway to use a restroom.  I was expecting an elegant, old-timer ice cream parlor feel, but this place is no where near that. I can't imagine buying the $1000 sundae here. There were a bunch of teens hanging around a cash register by the door which was confusing because the waiter who just left the check didn't specify if he was going to take the payment or if we were to pay at the cash register by the door.  Sooo after waiting around awhile, we stood by the cash register while they asked us what our waiter looked like and then gave the payment to him.  No eye contact, "thanks", "come back again" from the waiter...so we just walked out. Overall I felt like I was just at a fast food place, but with exorbitant prices, grumpy waiters, & pretty plates.
1221	0	Despite meeting Wilmer Valderrama, Mike Tyson, and Alonzo Mourning here, this place was an absolute nightmare.  We each paid $40 cover to cram onto the dance floor like packed sardines.  If I ever came here again, I'd stay outdoors the whole time.  Indoors is like driving in LA traffic...total buzzkill.
857	0	Please don't ever come here! If you love your family do not eat at this place. First things first walking in is the horrible smell. It smells like the inside of a nursing home. No lie. Secondly they do not have a person coming around taking your dirty plates, they will sit on your table for a while in the way of your food. Third it's in the ghetto which would be okay if they had good food and customer service which they do not. Inside gives you the feel that a fight can break out and end up on world star and any moment. And last but not least when we were finished eating sitting and talking about how we will never come here again we see one of the workers cleaning the Buffett area and putting all the food that drops around the sides BACK IN WITH THE OTHER FOOD. I am so traumatized
153	0	Unfortunately, this bar has false advertisement provided by desperate promoters outside the bar. First off they give you a bracelet and make you believe that the entrance is free, when it really wasn't.  Second,  the promoter told us that the bar closes at 4 am, we got there about 2 am and they ended kicking everybody out at 315. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!  I'll never go back.
1897	1	We came here looking for a great burger and a great time and got both.  Walked in and got seated right away and had a nice waiter who was on the ball.   Ordered the Berry Fresh cocktail, the Jalapeno Margarita, and a couple beers (one was the house lager free when you check in with Yelp).   All came to our table very quickly and were quite tasty.  They don't skimp on the alcohol here.     I ordered the Gold Standard Burger and hubby had the Rising Sun.   I loved my burger and if you go upgrade to the Onion rings.  Huge, crispy and delicious!   Hubby was pleased withe his burger as well.  The tomato confit on both of them is awesome.     Food was quick and we were happy for less than 70 bucks in Vegas.    Enjoy!! Can't wait for our Holstein's to open in Portland!
1155	0	This casino buffet could do way better for the price they charge their customers. The quality of the food is mediocre. Crab legs were avaliable but only chilled ones. No hot steamy ones. Overall the food just reminds me of eating at a malls for court.
1760	1	Super Fast service.....  amazing food. WHY DO WE NOT HAVE THESE IN THE BAY?!?!?  Ugh, totally worth the wait if theres a line....burger buns are like hawaiian rolls (i think) and these cheese fries, omg to die for! totes worth squeezing in the dress you'll have to wear later that night!
1993	1	The hubs was right ~ the best Thai food ever.    The restaurant is unassuming from the outside, but once you step in the doors, a nice wine cellar is the backdrop for the hustle and bustle of a wonderful establishment.    Friendly service.  Super flavorful dishes and moist, tender meats.    We ordered:  - Crispy Rice appetizer - spicy and sour.  Puckering.  Party in my mouth. - Beef Salad - tender beef slices on tasty greens - Chicken Skewers - so dainty and tender.  Not your average chicken skewer. - Duck Curry - tender and lightly crisp duck pieces over noodles with curry.  Star of the show.   All delicious.  Very, very good.  Thanks, Lotus of Siam ~ you guys rock!
177	0	I came here for lunch the day after my 21st and don't remember it being as spectacular as others have described. I do remember the line stretching out to Circus Circus and the variety of food being underwhelming. Definitely beats Hometown Buffet but for $20+ at lunchtime, they aren't the greatest deal on the strip, either. The quality of food seemed a notch above some others on the strip but it is definitely a bit overpriced considering the lack of variety. I would rather eat at Pharaoh's Pheast.
1312	1	Love this place!! Every time I come to Vegas I make sure to make a stop here and enjoy the banana nut muffin that tastes like heaven! The staff is always friendly and they place a newspaper style menu for you to look at. If you say it's your first time, most waitresses will bring you complimentary banana muffins for your table. But don't worry if they don't because most breakfast plates either come with toast or muffin..... Please go for the banana nut muffin!!! It's that good! For food I recommend the works skillet or any of their omelettes. They also have Hawaiian style food, which I haven't had the chance to try. The wait can go fast although it might take longer for larger groups. Parking can be a hassle during weekends. This restaurant will beat any overprice buffets on the strip, it's well worth it to go out of the strip for the food. And if you enjoy the muffin as much as I did, they sell banana nut loafs!
1798	0	I give one star because the only thing I ate that was good was the omelette. I mean you can't mess up a bacon and spinach omelette...can you? Everything else was disgusting, tasteless, bland, flavorless and just down right gross. I only tried this place because it was part of the runner perks for the Rock and Roll marathons, so it wasn't a first choice for buffet. Now I know where to NOT go. The "waiters" are not even waiters, they are just busboys. You have to grab your own drink, they don't even bring it for you, including sodas, teas, beer and drinks at the bar, you get yourself. All they do is pick up your plates. So basically its not too much service on their end. It's sad because there alot of food here, but they are all horrible. Pick another place!!!
1724	1	We were in Vegas for a day and needed a place to take the family of 7 to breakfast.  Checked Yelp and this place was rated #2 for the area.  So we drove over.  When we arrived, the restaurant was full and there were about 20 people waiting outside.  To me, that was a good sign.  We put in our name and waited only about 15 minutes to get seated.    We were immediately greeted by our server Kat and while we were looking at the huge breakfast menu, she was busy slinging our coffee and juices.  It is really hard to make a selection off of their menu.  Everything sounded really good.  Even Kat (the server) couldn't narrow it down to the "best item."  She said the best she could do was a "top 10."    We all ordered something different.  I had the Blackened Prime Rib Eggs Benedict.  It was really amazing.  The Hollandaise sauce tasted exactly how it was supposed to taste.  The Prime Rib could have been a little more blackened for my taste buds, but it was still very good.  Other members of my group had the Hawaiian breakfast with Portuguese Sausage, eggs and sticky rice.  Also ordered was the Chicken Fried Steak Skillet, the Blueberry Waffles, Blueberry Pancakes and your basic egg, meat and potato dish.  Everything was good.  Everyone at the table was raving at how good the food was and how they were all happy with their choices.  The banana nut muffins were an extra special treat.    One more thing.  The service was amazing.  Kat was great...and the manager even came out and checked on us.  Great service!  And, to top it all...all seven of us and were out the door in under an hour even though it was a packed house.    So if you are visiting Vegas and looking for a place to go, forget those expensive buffets and places on the strip and head over to this place.  I guarantee you that you won't be disappointed!
98	0	I was SO EXCITED to try this place and I only ended up being beyond disappointed . The service was horrible and rude, the wait was long, many things were overpriced, and the frozen hot chocolate wasn't special whatsoever. Overall, this place is far over hyped and simply not worth it at all.
1314	1	I mean seriously, Thai food doesnt get better than this. From the Bible sized wine list to the drunken seafood noodles, try it all! you won't be disappointed. Just one tip, be prepared to wait a while if you go on a weekend or during busy convention times or whatnot. Also, it's much less questionable looking inside than out... dont judge it by the scuzzy strip mall location.
544	0	Wow.  Wish I had checked Yelp before eating here.  The place is kinda neat looking - bunch of little goldfish, some of which swim upside down (for fun??)  Food is terrible.  Don't be fooled by the cheong-sam dressed Asians they have at the front.  Actually, that should have been a warning sign.  It being a "Chinese restaurant" in Caesar's should have been warning enough.  The place advertises itself as "authentic" hand-pulled noodles.  Yes, it's noodles.  And NO, it ain't authentic.  Supposedly their "best-seller" was the hand pulled noodles with shrimp/pork wontons.    The noodles were the WORST I have had in a long time.  Soggy, sad, thin little things with no texture.  Wontons were nothing to write home about.  Soup was on par with Cup O Noodles broth.  A relatively small bowl of -- blah -- for:                                          ****   $17.00  ****  Tip: DON'T GO.  Or, if you must go, don't expect authentic food.  (ps - the one star is for the cute fish!)
537	0	Was with a group of business colleagues for a pre-set meal. The service was excellent, but the food left a lot to be desired. Chicken Piccata was flavorless and served on a bed of pasta that was even more bland. Others shrugged off their food (steak and Cannelloni)with a "Meh, not so good." I had expected much better.  Chocolate raspberry cake was yummy.
1178	1	Unbelievably, Incredibly Good  I'll spare you a lengthy read.  I came up with the crazy idea to take my wife to one of her favorite restaurants for her birthday.  We flew from San Francisco to Las Vegas to have lunch here.  AND IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT!!  We will do it again.  It was our second meal there - every bit as good as the first.  The location is not great, but the food is utterly amazing.  EAT HERE.
840	0	Dear Pink's,    I hate you.  I had one in LA and it was ok but I was hoping for better...I'm not sure why I thought it would be better.  I think it's similar to when you see a McD's ad and you hope your burger looks like the ad but it's the same pile of crap every time.    The chili was bland and the hot dog was not as good as Nathan's hot dogs.    I'm pretty sure the chili dog meal looked the same entering and exiting my body!
1633	0	I haven't been south of TI in the longest time, but I ended up staying at Riviera due to a last minute mix up at the Palazzo *cries*.   First and foremost, the door of our suite did not lock. HUGE no no. We requested to have it fixed, but by the end of our stay, our room was STILL open for anyone! What the heck!  The valet service and check in was mediocre, but I could tell that they were super backed up. I think they have a staffing issue at Riviera. Maybe it's time to call a hospitality consulting company? Gotta keep up with all the new hotels on the strip!  In general, everything was decently clean, but just for the lock service (or lack there of), I think I'm going to have to give this a one. :(
405	1	Second time coming here and quality and value still as good as the first. We were a group of 5 people. We got the gangnam for two people and added extra meat to it and it was enough for all of us.    Service is awesome and fast. Servers were attentive and friendly. Never felt bad to stop anyone and ask for a favor. Willing to come back!
1450	0	This club is way too small. It is super packed barely any room to dance and you would have to reserve a vip table to have some space. It's not worth it in my opinion. The music is really good and the whole set up is really nice but it is just too small of a club.
1285	0	So I have to preface this by saying I have not stayed here again since my previous review. BUT I did walk out to the pool deck last week around 3am to dip my toes in the water, and I was rudely turned away by the security guard who informed me that the pool is NO LONGER open 24/7. So the only reason I would ever stay here is nonexistent. SEE YA Hooters.
1714	0	Cost: $20.48 for the lunch buffet (tax included)  They have a huge selection of food, but everything looked so unappetizing. Everything looked cold and stale. I picked up some sweet potato fries, a piece of catfish, mahi mahi, a bowl of wonton noodle soup, a vegetable spring roll, and a bowl of chicken congee. I broke my personal rule of not eating Asian food at an American buffet once again, but after two nights of partying in Vegas, I was desperately craving for something Chinese. The chicken congee really hit the spot. Way too salty, but it was comfort food. The wonton noodle soup was okay. The MSG soup was a nice cure for my semi-hangover, but the wonton filling had a mushy, pasty texture which I didn't like. Everything else was pretty bad. Tasted exactly as it looked... uninviting.
829	0	I have been to this location many times and, as usual, it disappointed me again. I always hope that things will change but they don't. The Founders Sirloin Filet that they advertise is extremely fatty and very tough to chew. The Garlic Marinated Sirloin is rationed. If you want more than one piece you need to make a second trip to get it. Apparently the employees can only give you one piece at a time. A lot of the dishes were not at the proper temperature (not hot enough). The service is terrible. When I pointed out a problem to one of the management team I was told "Don't worry about it" as if this person could not be bothered. I drove quite a distance to eat here because it's the only Golden Corral in Las Vegas. No more. I'm not going to waste precious gas to be disappointed and treated like crap. I'd rather eat at Burger King.
1183	1	One of the best burgers I've had in Vegas, hands down.   We had a bit of a wait (~15 minutes) before being seated, but it wasn't too bad. You can hang out in the middle of the mall and people watch until your buzzer goes off. The place feels kind of cramped once you're in there. At least it did for us. We were in a table in the middle, between the bar and some booths, but who's complaining? It's Vegas, and if you don't like crowds it sucks to be you.  A quick pitcher of beer set the dinner off right and we followed it up with a couple burgers (it IS the Burger Bar) that were cooked exactly the way we ordered them. My wife likes hers medium and I'm a burnt to a crisp kind of guy, which usually means one of us gets hosed. But not this time!  The shakes were awesome, too!
891	1	I ate here on my birthday and then I seriously dreamt about it for days on end so I had to come back within a week.  The Miyagi-san burger is amaaaazeeee and so are the oxtail chili cheese fries & truffle parmesan fries.  Service is great, but they seem really rushed.  I don't mind, because I'd rather spend more time eating my food than talking to the server.
903	0	If i can give them negative stars i would i booked a room with my gf the room was whatever until we noticed a broken window with lipstick on it we werent gonna be in the hotel room se we left we didnt want to complain so we checked out the next morning and i see my bank statement chared extra from the hotel i call and they said they were charging us for damages "manager" lilly is very disrespectful i get mad immediately because how did they not notice this on the last persons visit shes saying do you want my help?I reapond yeah you need to help me this is not right and she goes no i dont have to help you you want my help and transfers me to security im transfered to a guy who puts me on hold without saying anything and tries to give me another guys number to call monday i say thats unacceptable and he hangs up on me i call back to talk to lily and she transfers me without responding this is the WORST VISIT EVER,dont come here i will repost this review every other day until my money is refunded and im issues an apology stear clear of this hotel not worth it.
284	0	Our friend convinced us to check out Cravings buffet before the Love show and boy were we sorely wrong about this place. We came at 5pm and the food selection was temperature cold and we are not talking about the raw bar but the cooked heated food sections.  The only thing at the raw bar are crab legs.  The prime rib was not flavorful---lacked a distinct beef taste even with the Au Jus--remember to include the au jus...you'll need it since it is soooo dry and bland. The roast turkey was also bland and uneventful...thankfully they have turkey gravy a few feet away.   The Chinese and Japanese sections were terrible....the singapore rice noodles were overly seasoned with soy sauce which destroyed the curry flavor. the fried rice and steamed rice were colder than ice cream. the fried rice was overly seasoned with soy sauce.  the roast pork and duck were lifeless and bland...i've had better in Hong Kong....so don't expect much in this section.  the italian and latin foods were also bland, salty and cold.   TIP: if you want hot food, eat whatever you pick right then and there since by the time you get to your table, the food will be cooooooooooooold.   the only lifesaver was the service from our waiter...he was great and made the experience better....  the food is TERRRRRRRRRIBLE --- COLD, BLAND, SALTY and VARIETY CHALLENGED....SAVE your $ and avoid even the early bird special and go to the Wynn.
1413	1	More than a review this a request or better yet a plead, dear Bachi owner please open a Bachi restaurant in Portland, it has been more than 6 months since I moved from Las Vegas and I can not find a decent burger that vaguely resembles the taste of the Ronin, the Kiki, or the Miyagi San, I truly believe that Bachi had ruined any burger I may try, because all the time me an my family are comparing it to your Burgers!  Hoping to see Bachi around in Portland! otherwise I may need to seriously consider becoming a VEGETARIAN...
986	0	MGM Grand Hotel was one of my favorite Casino in Las Vegas.  Now I have to change my mind.  There Hotel service is way down and checking in takes way too long.  MGM I will keep my business with your family Casino line Aria and Etc.  But I don't think I will be stay in MGM Grand Hotel anymore.  Very disappointed!

I got sick post and probably ate about 4$ worth of the 60$ we paid. They EMT's were carrying a guy out on a stretcher as we arrived! Should have smelled what the Rock was cooking right then! Oh well, Panda Express would have been a better choice!
1334	1	With over 2,000 reviews, I am not sure that there is much that I can add.  But I do want to make one suggestion to Yelpers:  Please, please, PLEASE look at the Northern Thai section of the menu.  While the rest of the menu is very, very good (especially loved the Garlic Prawns and Sea Bass on Drunken noodles), the Northern Thai section offers dishes that you won't find at most Thai restaurants.  We had two standouts, both based on recommendations of our very attentive waiter.  The first was Kang Ka Noon, which is jackfruit in a spicy curry sauce.  An article on NPR says that these are the largest tree fruit in the world, reaching up to 100 lbs each, and high in protein, potassium, and vitamin B2 (and yes, they are quite an interesting looking fruit).  However, when it is cut up and put into a dish, the jackfruit has the consistency of an artichoke heart.  Smooth, creamy and delicious.  And the curry sauce adds the perfect spice to balance the simple sweetness of the fruit.  The second dish was Khao Soi, a curried, egg noodle dish (with Burmese flavor influences) that we had with chicken.  Much like Pho has its salad accompaniment, so does Khao Soi:  onions, mustard greens, and lime.  Oh my goodness was this dish fantastic.  It was clearly the hit of the night.  So if you are an adventurous foodie (and you likely are if you are reading reviews in Yelp), step away from the traditional and go right for the Northern part of the menu.  You will not be sorry.

After all that is why the buffets in Vegas are so great. They did have a good dessert selection. Cotton candy machine, ice cream and mini doughnuts.
1971	0	Only giving it two stars because we got a comp for it. Otherwise I might have given it one. We went for lunch and there were not very many offerings set out. We could hardly find anything we wanted to eat. What we did try was very non-remarkable. Had a couple of decent desserts but as far as the food, BLAH.
114	0	When it comes to Lee's Sandwiches, I'll guess the answer is I'll have to come back in a few months to see if they're doing anything differently.    Unlike a few other Yelpers who have had a Lee's Sandwich experience before, I've never been to this chain and really wanted to go as soon as they opened.  I really like banh mi and wanted to see if this place stacked up to other local establishments.  Unfortunately the service was super slow (perhaps due to being relatively new) and the sandwiches were not up to par.  I found them to be REALLY skimpy on the toppings as there were quite a few bites of my charbroiled pork sandwich that consisted of just bread and pickled carrots. I brought a bunch of friends with me to try it out and their sandwiches were equally..."empty".  I hope they understand that my desire to go to Lee's was to try them for the first time and not to show them a great place to eat.  As with some other places to eat here in Vegas, Lee's seems to be one of those places that is good just because it's open.  The quality is not there, we experienced really slow service and the sandwiches are skimpy.  I like the baguettes but there are better if I'm willing to drive to them.   Overall, not the best, but something to eat if you need to soak up some alcohol after a night of going out.  As I'm a cab driver, I'll probably never go there for that reason so I guess I'll go back in about 6 months to see if they've gotten any better.   Before I forget, it seems that Lee's has an abundance of ice as their drinks (coffee, iced tea or soft drinks) are mostly ice.  Make sure you don't get thirsty here as their drinks are mostly comprised of ice and you could end up spending a fortune to quench your thirst!  Maybe that will make the sandwiches seem like a better deal?
606	1	Wow, was Lotus of Siam excellent! Wonderful service, the most extensive list of German wines I've seen outside of Germany (and what could go better with Thai food than German wine?) and outstanding food, the best Thai I've ever had. The northern Thai sausage was my favorite item, followed closely by the eggplant and mushroom appetizer. Lots of complex flavors expertly developed. My thanks to Anthony Bourdain for the recommendation.
756	1	I've been meaning to start writing Yelp reviews for a while now, and I've repeatedly considered what business would receive my first review. I've decided that it HAS to be the Peppermill and it HAS to be five stars.  (For this review, I'm focusing strictly on the lounge.)  My wife and I are Las Vegas locals now, but we've been frequenting the Fireside Lounge since our tourist days. We came here on the night we got engaged. We came here on the night we got married. We come here on our birthdays and anniversaries. There simply isn't any place in town more comfortable and romantic for a couple of kitsch lovers like us.  Sure, the strip location means it gets crowded on the weekends - moreso lately than it used to, it seems - but scoring a seat on one of the plush pink couches around the firepit makes it more than worth the trip. The waitresses are super-friendly and they'll remember you between visits.  My only complaints are that the drinks are a little weak and the music selection a little poppy. The former is because I've been conditioned by super-strong Fink Bombs at Frankie's Tiki Room, and the latter is because I'm apparently a hipster douche. Neither complaint is worth tarnishing a perfect score.  The Peppermill is easily one of our favorite places on the entire globe and now it's only a couple of miles down the street from us. We're so lucky to now live so close to this neon-encrusted gem.
1857	0	A stinker. You know, I'm having a hard time trusting people's review, especially when a user's average review rating is four to five stars for several hundred reviews. Does that mean the majority of buisnesses are winners? I guess I'm gullible.  Bayside Buffet is a prime example of why I shouldn't be so eager to try a place recommended by Yelpers. And yet, Im writing one, too! Double standards am fail.  Anyway, bitching aside, my lunch here was super meh. 20 dollars paid at the kiosk, then briskly seated facing away the window (wut?), and then hoarded to the buffet line on both sides of the room. Immediately, I had a nagging feeling the experience would be super meh. How? Oh, let's see...the buffet selection is hella small! My college cafeteria offered more food than this -- and at better quality!   So what did I get?  Meats, a few starches, but mainly stuff jammed with protein.  Lambchops: Ugh. Below super meh. The lamb was gamey and foul tasting, an instant spit-out-of-the-mouth-and-eat-somethingelse-to-purge-the-mouth type thang. Minus points. Pork ribs: Wow, surprisingly soft, but lacked flavor. This was the best entree at the buffet. Turkey: Eh, thanksgiving turkey cut in your choice of dark or white meat. The carver was very nice, but the meat quality was very poor. Braised beef: This better be soft, or else I'm leaving! Fortunately for me, the beef was soft, though a weird aftertaste soured my mouth. Flank steak: Worst meat. I couldn't get steak down my mouth, because the texture was way too chewy. TOO CHEWY. Inedible. Even beef jerky is softer than this flank steak. Mash potatoes: Wait, yelpers, you like this crap? Buttery? Yummy? Uh... I give up.   Dessert Forget the banana pudding, the fruit pudding, the cakes, the brownies; the best dessert is the frozen yogurt. YES. Better than McDonalds frozen yogurt, the barometer for tasty, creamy, consistent goodness. The vanilla custard yogurt was by far the best part of the meal...  ...and the saddest part of the experience. Deserts over meats and entrees? Bayside Buffet, you fail.   And, oh, your service sucks.
768	1	We heard that breakfast here was a chance to eat a fairly affordable meal ($15-$22) at a Thomas Keller restaurant.  We came here on a weekday morning just after 9am and were seated promptly with a smile, a few rows away from the small pool outside (the hostess joked that it was the Venetian's "kiddie pool").  The restaurant is smaller than I thought it would be, with very high ceilings and an airy, sunlit atmosphere.    I had the Breakfast Jardiniere with eggs over medium, choosing a chocolate croissant.  It was obvious that the chefs really pay attention to the details.  The croissant came first with a cup of fruit.  Flaky and amazingly buttery, the croissant had delicious bittersweet chunks of chocolate.  Each cube of fruit, whether grape or cantaloupe, was sweet and ripe.   The eggs came with a toasted brioche, sauteed spinach, and a side of potatoes cut to the size of nickels.  The eggs were an incredibly deep yellow color (from naturally-raised chickens, perhaps?) that I haven't seen from eggs in ages.  The light oil and salt on the potatoes made for a tiny dance of flavor in my mouth.  The sauteed spinach came with big chunks of garlic.  I'm a real garlic lover, so I actually wanted an even stronger garlic taste from the spinach, but I couldn't complain about the tender texture.  I also tried the Oeuf Au Gratin, a deep dish of baked eggs that was a spoonful of richness.  Their coffee was excellent, and their orange juice was very good as well.  I'm recommending this breakfast to all my friends that are headed to Vegas.  Breakfast service ends at 10:30am I believe, which might be difficult for the night-owl party types in Sin City.
863	1	Great service, eggceptional food.  I wish we had such a breakfast place in Salt Lake City. Carla too amazing care of us, and our meals were prepared perfectly, even though the portions were too big.     It was my second or possibly third visit here, and it is consistently great.
1303	0	Harold and Kumar traveled how far for these dumb burgers...  Totally not worth the hype. My ex stoner roommate was obsessed with White Castle and used to buy the frozen ones.. So when I tried these for the 1st time I couldn't believe how it tastes exactly the same (yuk)  People were buying them by the case when we walked in, total disappointment. People in the east coast got it all wrong these soggy sliders are crappy. Another reason the west coast rules.
1215	0	My girlfriends who traveled and visited Las Vegas for bachelorette parties always bragged about this place. I think this place is pretty and very girly but nothing special about the food. I begged my boyfriend to take me here and we only shared the cookies and cream sundae. It's good but taste like a milkshake! I rather sit on the couch and buy a big blue bell carton tub and share it with my boyfriend. There's plenty of other gorgeous places with better food.   Oh yeah, if you're a fan of the show "Tanked" on Animal planet and coming here to look for the gumball fish tank, it's not here anymore. I read somewhere in the summer it got too hot and the fish got fried. Ouch! Poor fishies.
704	1	Love this place--it's like Cheers, everybody knows my name! Been eating here since I was in Elementary school....did you know this place opened up in 1983? Just a little food for thought! :)  Anyway, about the food...I love and highly suggest the: -Italian skillet -Corn beef hash And my new favorite... -Pork Carnitas!!!!!! (Drool)  Do yourself a favor and give this place a shot, it's an oldie but a goodie! :)
753	1	Loved this place! Everything was exceptional; the service was excellent, the restaurant was extremely busy, my friend and I both ordered the Chef Ramses' infamous beef Wellington. We waited two hours to receive our entrees :( definitely worth the wait. I ordered the mac and cheese and my friend ordered the asparagus to accompany our meals. When we finally received our entrees it was too late to eat our sides, we just devoured our wellingtons. Food was delicious, will definitely recommend an earlier reservation on the weekends since it's so busy, food takes longer to arrive. It does say on the menu beef Wellington will take about 45 min to cook but 2 hours was a bit too long.
928	0	went on a sunday night with a 50.00 groupon.unlike other places that look at you like you have not showered for a while they where fine with it.asked them if i needed a reservation and they said no so went and did sunday shopping in the miracle mile shops and played the machines for about an hour.rolled back up and was greeted and seated right away. asked and got the table i wanted right near the bar so i could watch a little football.server greeted me in a timely manner.didnt need him to explain the menu as i had been to churascarrias before.went to the salad bar and got some cheese and cheeses bread.the bananas and mashed potatoes where on the salad bar,which i had never seen done before as the back waiter brings them out to you at the other brazilian steakhouses,but seeing as how he didnt have a back waiter i suppose that would say it all.so to the food. i tried everything that they offerred twice,first go around i thought my taste buds were deceiving me as i could not taste any flavor.nope ,i was right,everything was completely tasteless, whereas as tex. de brazil, yolies seemed overly seasoned[although that seemed to be remedied on my last visit] teir rodizio seemed to not be sasoned at all.i you already have a groupon you might as well go as you can do a little shopping and gamblingwhile you are there,but there are better tasting rodizios, that have more buzz about them around town.i gave this only two stars because of the food and ambience,i would give the service 4 stars.
69	0	The worst of the worst...... Omg....... Don't even think or get attempt by it from buy one get one coupon....  Horrible... Very narrow choices of food and taste is the worst.. Everything is either sweet or way too salty... I couldn't even eat two plates... Will never come back....
698	1	One of my absolute favorite restaurants!  The burger quality is perfect.  I usually go for well done because I don't like ANY pink but when I come to Bachi I make sure I order it medium rare because the flavor is SO much better.  The service here is quite slow and often times they have forgotten an item we ordered but to me its absolutely worth the wait.  We always get the garlic chili edamame, truffle fries and salt and vinegar fries.   We also love the Oxtail fries but really recommend to buy it when you're with a bigger group since it is  A LOT of food.   ENJOY!  :D
1159	1	Another night in Vegas, another wonderful steakhouse.  Gordon Ramsay steak is one of the newer upscale steakhouses in Vegas and is located conveniently in the center of the strip at the Paris hotel.  I have eaten at some of the other Gordon Ramsay eateries in Vegas and neither of them compare to this one.  In fact, very few steakhouses on the strip compare to this.  The decor, the service, and the food are all fantastic.  We first started with some drinks, bread (some of the best free bread around) and the seafood platter for 4.  This was one of the best tasting seafood platters I have had.  Everything was fresh and came with a variety of sauces which were amazing.  The crab and lobster was especially tasty.   After the starter, I ordered the salmon and the table also shared a porterhouse.  The salmon was very good, and actually a very good portion size.  Normally they make the salmon with a cauliflower puree that when you squeeze lemon over it, it turns purple, but I think they did a seasonal vegetable with it this time (which stayed one color).  The porterhouse was as good as it gets.  Nothing to fancy on the cook, just a very flavorful and moist steak.  Make sure to get a few extra bites off the bone, that's where you get some of the best meat bites.    The spinach at GR is also one of the best sides I've ever had.  Just a great blend of garlic and oil to make the spinach super tasty and not too drenched.    For desert I tried the peanut butter bar.  Very good, but nothing amazing.  Overall, one of my favorite meals in Vegas.
256	0	So my boyfriend was giving me a hard time for being a bratty princess with the need to stay at a fancy place. Ok, fine, I'll show you. I booked this hotel as a Christmas "gift" to him just to show I can stay in such "cheap" place.   And boy was this cheap, as in, cheap in every way. The room was mediocre at best. The floors had stains of god knows what and the bathroom arrangement was retarded. Only the shower and toilet was on tiled floor, the sink is outside in the carpeted area. It  was... stupid. The walls were ridiculously thin and you can hear EVERYTHING. My friend told us about his bad experience with LVH with the maids throwing away all of his stuff had me paranoid so we stuffed our belongings in drawers and closets as well as took pictures of them to make sure we have proof. Luckily nothing happened but I do not want to go through that ordeal of feeling unsafe.   My boyfriend said we're never staying here again. HA! Proved you wrong hunny and even you were appalled.   DON'T STAY HERE!
1613	1	By far the best breakfast I've ever had. The breads, toasts and croissants are all fresh and made on site. Jams and jellies are... Well let's just say everything on the menu from the breakfast sausage to the orange juice is made on site by Thomas Keller's staff... need I say more. If you want breakfast in Vegas this is the only place to go!!
1880	0	Very high prices, poor quality food and painful karaoke makes this a mildly entertaining venue. Service is VERY slow; I suspect as a result of goo people spread thin. Consumer expectations are not high coming in but hey...it is an "experience" that out of towers enjoy...once.
879	1	The food was great, huge portions.  We couldn't finish our plates.  The presentation was excellent complete with sage and twigs.  The service was great, Robert P. was very helpful with the menu.  Seeing that Man Vs Food and the New York Times liked the Sage Chicken, I had to give it a try, and it didn't dissapoint.  They also have a great wall of fame at the entrance.
1846	1	These are seriously some of the best burgers I have ever had.  I don't know how they do it but the meat is out of this world delicious and tender and the sauces are really good and usually ask for them on the side.  They even have turkey and salmon burgers. Would love to try them all.
1804	1	This is definitely some of the best NY style pizza I have ever had and you can find it here at the Cosmopolitan on the 3rd floor. Located next to the sushi restaurant, it's well hidden and literally a hole in the wall since there are no signs that direct to it. Once you see the pinball machine in the alley then you have found it!  Well it's a cool spot, they have two pinball machines at the front. The pizza is really great and they're open until 5 in the morning. This is one of the true hidden gems on the Las Vegas strip and the pizza is affordable which is great considering how expensive the food on the strip can be.  Highly recommended!
30	0	They have different sections of food, mexican, american, italian, chinese but not a big selection of each. And the food isnt the best. We went there bc of the unlimited beer, but it was only bud light and some other beer. It was too pricy for the selection if u ask me. $37 for dinner.
1434	1	Never disappointed whenever I go here. I live pretty far from the strip so this is a treat whenever I'm near the location! It's one of the better places to go for casual burgers, shakes, fries, etc! I love it so much and shakes are pretty good and I love the changing of the flavors they offer. I recommend this place over In N Out (sorry ) my boyfriend always tells his friends from out of town about this place and they also end up loving it too!
1848	0	We tried this place about 2 years ago for dinner and I recalled the food was pretty good so this trip we stopped there for lunch. The location is awesome, with a great view of the Bellagio fountains which our daughter loves. So we get there and I ask the hostess if we could get a seat outside in the front. She doesn't smile, isn't pleasant one bit and asks, well, are you going to be eating?  Um, what do you think we came here to just sit at lunchtime?  She stands there looking puzzled for about 20 seconds, then finally took us to the seats without saying anything.  The waiter was cool but man, the food sucked - I had burrito and hubby had combo plate.  He asks for spicier salsa... we charge extra for that... jalapenos?  we charge extra for that.... really? You're charging 14 bucks for a burrito and you can't throw us some lousy jalapenos??  Never coming here again that's for sure... terrible hostess, terrible food at high prices.
241	0	I've been dying to check out Serendipity 3.  And yes, I did read the Yelps beforehand but since Janice C., my friend that lives in Vegas, & I still wanted to check it off our to do lists we decided to go to the To Go area outside since the hostess said their system was down to take reservations (I called ahead of time) and the wait would be around a half hour.  The To Go menu has a lot less attractive items on the menu.  The wait was still very long for bf & I to get our kobe sliders & fries.  And Janice C. who was behind us her salad came after the order of the guy behind her!  Who puts one cook in such a popular To Go window of the restaurant?!    The kobe sliders weren't bad, but $9 for 3 of them...geeze...happy hour somewhere else would have been cheaper!  The fries were alright too, wish they were a little crispier however.  I had a sip of my friend's frozen hot chocolate, it was alright, nothing special really and not worth $10!  The outdoor seating was kind of limited, but luckily there were a couple empty tables which were not tended to.  The misters could have been stronger and better aimed.    I may try to go to the original location AND eat there whenever I go to NYC, but as for this location, no thanks, it's overpriced & overrated!
451	1	Quite possibly the best New York style pizza you'll find on the West Coast. If you've dealt with sub-par NY pizza around town, come to this pizza place and you will not be disappointed.  As you walk through the vintage Italian album collage leading to pizza paradise, you'll find a few gems - including an old San Remo cover - before finding your cheesy reward.  They use cornmeal to crisp the crust and the cheese is stringy and delish.  It feels like a pizza speakeasy amid so many trendy restaurants on that level inside Cosmopolitan, but well worth the mystery hunt to get there.
272	0	what?!?!? really it is the hilton!!!! so many things went wrong! first we originally booked a king gave us a double... then they switched us out the next day only to have a clogged tub!!! then the room they switched us out.. people were still occupying it!! so the last room they gave us.. sink didn't work, tub was dripping really badly, and the phone didn't work!!! by then we were way exhausted to change rooms!!! the hallways were dirty! the rooms were dusty!!! etc!!! WE HATED IT!
1377	0	Attitude doesn't get tips. They charged to watch a fight. Once you're in, they charge to allow to be seated to eat.  I didnt want to be charged to be seated so we went to the outside bar under a heater. The table in front of us didn't get a working heater so the waiter decides to take the one we were comfortably standing under.  Wow just because we didnt pay the Extra $$ ! Really?!?! I explained to the waiter he didnt need to take the heater we were under becuase as they said "first come first serve" I guess we need to pay for the heater too! How much?? I already paid $50 per bucket of beers (x2 so far). Purchased food, .... anything else we gotta pay for?
1066	0	We ate lunch there twice during our stay ... both times were just so-so.  I've read some of the previous reviews, and don't know what "variety" some of you are referring to.  I am not a picky eater but could only find a few items to eat.  My husband and I also received the 2 for 1 offer for the buffet.  Yes, it was cheaper than going to some of the other buffets but I really don't think it was worth the savings.  They had no seafood whatsoever during the week (for lunch or dinner ... we went in late for lunch and hung out for dinner).  The best thing about the place was their fresh salad bar where they make the salad any way you like.  The desserts were awful ... minus the homeade powdered donuts which were excellent.  Would I come back again?  No way.  We went to the buffet in Harrah's and spent less than what we did at the buffet in TI (with a 2 for 1 coupon) and it was delicious.  If you wait around until it's lunch time they will serve prime rib, peel and eat shrimp, ham, etc.
520	1	LOVED this place!! I didn't eat at the restaurant as when we went there was quite a wait so we opted to sit fireside (in the lounge) and order drinks and apps.  First off the hostess and wait staff were friendly and helpful.  Our waitress answered all our questions about drinks and when one of the couples with us ordered the large nachos she recommended the small and boy am I glad she did because the small could easily feed 4-6.  The drinks were well priced and made well.  I opted for the Bloody Mary while the BF got The Scorpion (as seen on TV) - both were mighty tasty.  Our group not only had the nachos but also the BBQ sliders, ribs and the app sampler.  All were made really quick and tasted good.  There was even a photographer who came around and took group pics of us (free of charge).  We showed up around 4pm on a Friday and though the fireside table was reserved at 7pm the waitress politely notified us but didn't pressure us to leave or even move (which we did when more of our party showed up around 6:30pm).  All in all I give this place 5 stars and will be going back next time I'm in Vegas!
950	0	Food barn.  There is no ambiance to look at. Just carpeted floor, barely smiling hosts and mediocre food.  I don't think it's worth it even with the discount coupons. I would like to give this a higher rating but there is really nothing that stands out fromt heir offerings.  Cotton Candy and their Middle Eastern section is the only saving grace from another deduction.  Some say that there is quality. They may be eating from the floor then.   Sorry.
1188	1	Me and my family went early around 730am or so and I have never been here before, the young gentleman who was really young was very swell and respectful and was caring that I had a infant and I thank him for being caring about him. Well mannered, our waiter was knowledgeable and very cool, I didn't catch his name but had a great sleeved tattooed on his right arm. The muffins are out of this world, they were so hot and fresh I was worried I want going to have room for my actual breakfast  The eggs bennidict were so delicious had a great zest to the sauce. The potatoes would have been great but there was a large amount of pepper and there specialty El Diablo of some sort of spice they created but ask them for easy on the spice. Other that great food good price. Had to take the remainder of my portion a home and I would go back
810	0	The service is so horrendous it's laughable. The food is mediocre at best. Came in with a party of 7. The place was busy, but not insane. I ordered a skinny margarita. Not bad. After I got my drink I had decent expectations. Table got guac and chips. Not very good albeit expensive. My chicken quesadilla was greasy and tasted like canned chicken. My boyfriend got fish tacos, and they were a little better, but bland.  Our server was basically non-existent. My friend had to ask three different ppl for a lemon for her water. The food runner brought her some, after a ridiculous wait for our food. We would have ordered more cocktails, however we didn't get the opportunity to.  Don't even bother. This is Vegas. There are much better restaurants. My wallet hurts from the price gouge.
1586	1	Loved this place.  Went twice on my latest trip to Vegas and each time was great.  Had the gold standard and the long horn burger and each was fantastic.  The philly cheese steak rolls are to die for, but the artichoke guac is a miss.    Beer selection is off the charts and the servers were attentive and fun.
1523	1	I had to write an update to my review of Holstein's because it was even better the second time around!  Everything from start to finish was amazing, and we ordered a lot of stuff.  Even the complimentary popcorn tasted great and was not as over saturated with oil as my first visit here.  What really stole the show for me though was the Rising Sun burger.  It was the best thing that I ate in Vegas during my most recent visit, and I am salivating just thinking about it as I write this review.  I also shared sides of sweet potato fries, onion rings, and fried pickles with my wife, and I loved them all.  I was so glad that we came back to eat at Holstein's again when we were in Las Vegas, because it was my favorite meal of our trip.  I can't wait to come back here again soon!
1351	1	The bf and I ate here for our Valentines day breakfast. We loved it here!!  We had the corn beef hash, French Toast, and Croque Madame. The corn beef had cubed potatoes that were crispy. The Croque Madame's sauce had a rich tasty sauce and a lot of fries! The portions here are pretty big. Last but not least the french toast was different. It just had a lot of fruit. It reminded us of an upside down pineapple cake. Overall, the staff was exceptional, food was great, and the ambience was inviting nothing too fancy.
885	1	The Waffles and Sage Fried Chicken.... YUM!   My wife ordered the waffles and Chicken, I had the pancakes. While the pancake (singular) was impressive, there is only so much pancake I can eat in one sitting.   The Waffles and Chicken was very good. The waffles had thick cut bacon cooked into it and literally a mountain of food. The waiter told my wife good luck as he dropped it off and I could only roll my eyes as I knew it was on. Four Waffles and 2 pieces of chicken which next time we are going to split.  This location was absolutely packed with a short waiting list which was worth it. We'll be back!
915	1	We had a great time celebrating my sister's 40th birthday at Gordon Ramsay Steak.  The wait staff are very professional, attentive and knowledgable. The menu of drinks was impressive, too.  Food was fabulous and  was beautifully presented.  It is a little expensive, but very worth it for special events.
589	0	This place wasn't gross, but it wasn't good. I honestly just got a ton of salad and ice cream. I'd be pissed if I spent the full price on it but my friend checked in on Foursquare so we got a buy-one-get-one voucher so it was like $30 for the two of us for dinner. I guess it was fun to try a buffet in Vegas but maybe my expectations were a little too high? I'd rather have spent twice that and had a real meal at a good restaurant.  The desserts were the best part.
1777	0	Left without being served, waited over ten minutes and no one came to take our order.  Two ladies with children sat in booth behind us and we're served immediately....could it be because we were an older Asian couple that we were totally ignored???? I
920	0	Nothing Serendipitous about this place. It was overpriced and the hostess had about as much charm as my sweaty feet from walking in Vegas in 100 degree weather. A bad attitude too. I should've saw the red flag but we needed to evade the "Hot Babes Direct to You" swaggers for a while.  We just had desserts (which were pretty standard) so I can't comment on the food but I won't be back to find out. Our waitress was nice but overall this place had a really crappy vibe. Thanks but no thanks.
964	0	Its an ok, clean hotel...but the location kind of sucks and not quite up to some of the standards I've expereinced at other Westins. I mean, who goes to vegas to stay at the westin?  Unless you've stayed at every other hotel in town before (I have), I wouldn't recommend staying here on vacation.  For saving money, its fine....but I'd still prefer a strip hotel.
787	0	This place used to be pretty decent but we had the worst experience here this week. We got stuck in the West wing and our room was awful. I've stayed in better low end hotels like Motel 6 before. We were on the 5th floor and there has literally been a plate of room service waste sitting outside the elevators for the last 4 days! We will never stay here again!
543	1	5 Stars, and here is why....  1.  If the restaurant closes at 10pm, and you can still roll in at 9:55pm for a meal - Good.  The service is still excellent - Better.  The quality of the food is still exceptional - Best.  Lotus is tops on all three accounts!  2.  Wine List and Pairing.  Not only does Lotus have an outstanding wine list, it has the largest selection of German Whites in any restaurant - in the world, if memory serves.  Also, any restaurant whose wait staff knows wine enough to pair with my meal makes me happy.  However, despite the large number of Sommeliers and wannabes in Las Vegas, I rarely find a member of the general wait staff who can confidently assign a wine to my meal without looking at the price or without pairing  by color.  3.  Of course, the food!  I know that I've enjoyed a Larb Salad in another place better, but not an entire Thai meal.  To start, three of us ordered the Hot Pot-sized Thom Kha Kai, a wonderful coconut and lime-based soup with mushrooms and chicken, which was simply pleasing.  It was creamy, tart, sweet and savory; so perfectly balanced that it could have easily satisfied me as a main course.  Next, a Larb Salad (Chicken).  This could have been better to my taste, but was well-seasoned with mint and onions and very aromatic.  Finally, the main course - Nua Yang Panang.  I love Panang curries, and this one, with its embellishment of cognac, was one of the best I've ever had.  The sauce was so good my friends and I made balls of rice to sop up every last bit - the dishwasher got off easy with us!  4.  Price.  Yes, you can spend (and maybe should spend :)) $30-40/ person at Lotus of Siam.  Yes, you can probably make decent curries at home now without the time and expense thanks to the plethora of bottled Thai sauces - think Heinz 57 of Thai...blegh!  But the total bill for all of us including my $10 glass of Piesporter, the menu listed in #3 and another's fried rice, just cleared $60 with tax.  That's right folks $15 a person!  Can you eat at any other of the World's 100 Best Restaurants at dinner for $15?  I think I hear Thomas Keller laughing...nervously...  Bottom line:  Well, worth the drive from anywhere for the excellent quality, selection and service.  A super way to dine at one of the World's Best!
1443	0	ugggggggggggggggggghhhhh... I will never visit this place again!!!!  1- You are on the complete opposite side of the strip 2- they are still charging a crazy amount per night 3- The rooms are old, and make me want to sleep in my car.  The hotel is very old. I did not have the best experience there. I had to call room servicer to have them change my sheets. They were not clean. I dont recomend this place at all.  But on a bright side i will give the buffett a 5 stars. I keep telling myself tht if i go back to Vegas i will visti their buffett. You pay I believe $15 or $16 per person all you can eat. But they have a pasta buffett where they will cook you chicken, shrimp, with any kind of pasta i personally loved it this must of been the best thing about the entire trip. The buffett highly recomended. To stay, defenitley find else where.

1904	0	There's absolutely nothing presidential about the West Wing at this hotel. Over the years, we have stayed at almost every hotel on the strip and thought it would be fun to try something new. Pools were nice so had to give an extra star for this. However, the rooms were small, dirty and our sink wouldn't even drain. Yuck.  If you stay at the MGM, make sure you upgrade to a suite -maybe you will have better luck than we did. Would recommend Aria, Caesars or Venetian.
1623	0	unfortunately all the bad reviews lived up to the hype...being that it was my first time here it certainly will be my last, let's just say sizzler has a better buffet than here, the only thing that probably saved my not so great experience was the chicken dish and that was it, everything else was just screaming  cafeteria! Please don't waste your money
813	0	I wish I can give zero star if I can. The cashier & staffs were so rude, no willing to work there. The male manager who were working at when we were there, he wasn't willing to listen my complaint.   Here is the story.   I just came here at buffet and i spoke to one of their lady to ask how busy and what's their holiday pricing (usually pricing is different during the holiday). She seemed nice and she said 28.99 + tax. So I didn't buy the discount coupon from tix4tonight. And then I came here and they said pricing is 36.99. And they blamed me that I should remember the lady's name. Do you usually remember the person's name even if you want to ask the general question? Such Hours and pricing? If the manager knows how to treat customers, or manage his employees, they should give us the rate that she mentioned. I wasnt happy that he treated me and my family like this.
728	0	Went in for dinner. Greg was our waiter. My friend wanted spaghetti and a salad. He told her she didn't want salad the pasta dish was enough. REALLY! We were both drinking alcohol. Was not asked if we wanted another drink. Brought check to table before plates were removed. REACHED OVER ME to grab my wine glass without asking if I was done or wanted another glass. His service and attitude were so bad I can't even remember what the food tasted like.
1397	1	Took my car in today for a smog check.  Was very very pleased with the service.  First, I did not have to even get out of my car and then they brought all the paperwork right to the car for me to sign. The next best thing was it cost only $9.99. Really a great group of people and so friendly.  Will not go anywhere else again for smog check. Thank you all.
1952	0	It would be zero stars if there was an option.   I will ever visit this place again. It was not busy when we arrived but we still had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. That should have been my 1st clue to leave.    When we were finally seated the waitress appeared offering water we were already prepared to place our order from waiting so long.  She took our drinks order and about 15 min later the drinks arrived. My drink came in this Palm tree plastic cup hmm ok whatever it taste good so we placed our food orders and waited and waited about 30 min which would have been fine except when they brought the orders out it was the wrong items. I ordered the BLT wrap which was correct but my husband who is super sensitive with his food had ordered the carnitas plate. They bought him tacos. He is a diabetic and was very hungry and edgy at this point. We did not take the tacos the waitress said he ordered tacos my husband said no I ordered the carnitas plate. We said being the check.   Check arrived and they charged me $24 for my drink WHAT it was from the slush machine I was charged $11.25 for the plastic Palm tree cup I told her I didn't ask for the take home cup and didn't want it. She said you can just leave it then.     By this time I had it wrong food order waiting forever to be treated like this. Never again  I will be sure to share my review with others
991	0	The ONLY reason I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because they do have pretty good sushi.  HOWEVER - the hype about this place is so overdone that the staff has a huge attitude and they do not know how to treat guests.    My husband and I went around 7:30 on a Thursday night.  We were staying at the Venetian (the hotel connected to the restaurant), made reservations for both the restaurant and the nightclub.  After waiting an HOUR we finally got a table.  The place was dark, loud, and the layout made you feel very crowded.  It was difficult to see what we were eating, let alone have a conversation.  We dropped about $400 on dinner (we were celebrating and had a bottle of Veuve).    After dinner was over, we said we had reservations for the nightclub, the entrance to the club was literally 20 feet from our table.  Well, we had to get up, go outside the club, stand in a long "special line" and then wait in another "special line" in order to pay a $20 cover to go back through the restaurant we just left, back up the stairs we just came down, in order to get in.    Pathetic.    When we got inside, it got even worse.  The place was packed (it was only 10:30 p.m.!).  The bouncers were rude, the place was pitch black in some places - so it was a lot of bumping into people.  I would estimate that about 80% of every room in the entire club was sectioned off for VIP.  So unless you are ready to drop $300 on a $40 bottle of vodka, don't expect to have any room.
1165	0	Food tasted ok. Nothing special. The menu had maybe 10 items on it. Service was ok. Highlight was the lady making the balloon hats. She was amazing. Kids meals were almost $9 and nothing exciting. Atmosphere was dead. The Senor Frogs we've previously been to were amazing. This one sucked. Wouldn't recommend or go back.
7	0	Allergy to onions. Food came out with onions. Waited 15 minutes for drinks. No apology from the server. And she charged us for a side of mushrooms...which we never ordered nor did we receive. Manager said she could "look into it," but we had a flight to catch. I suggest waiting in line for ANY other restaurant before getting sat here right away...chances are you'll wait the same amount anyway.
1327	0	I am a cheap bastard sometimes, and my brother is as well so when we saw just off the strip for less than $50 a night over a weekend average price, we thought what the hell. My brother is so cheap that he still wears shirts from when he was in High school, (he is currently 36). Regardless we thought 3 *s (official rating on most websites) all we really need is 2 beds and a bathroom. Well being blunt if this is 3 Stars then I think the box under the bridge with the homeless must rank at least 2 stars! there was no chair for the desk (how did that leave the room?) the decor looked like Jimmy buffet threw up after drinking one too many different colored margaritas, the carpet was just dirty, the bathroom had mold in the corners of the linoleum floor, There was a foot hole kicked through the bathroom door. But the wings at the bar downstairs were good!
1218	1	First time having shake shack and it blew my mind! Anyone who says INN n out is better, is lying through they teef!  I'm going back to Vegas just for shake shack, not even kidding.   5/5 Original burger  5/5 BBQ burger 1/5 the jackpot , the cake tasted extremely stale 3/5 cheese fries
290	1	The best breakfast i ever had. U need to wait to get in there. Worth wait.  Any Omelet here is awesome wit Sides Cajun fries or french fries. Fruits on the side.  We ordered 7 different omelets. Each and every person have their own specifications. All our orders are perfect. The waiter's here are pretty cool. If i stayed back in vegas and longer i would eat my Breakfast only here.  They offered us the Banana Muffins after our meal. Thats really awesome. We couldn't eat them so they gave us ToGo.
258	1	I always get the Miyagi-San burger and truffle fries, but the porcini sauce on the fries never seems to be enough and I always have to ask for extra sauce which isn't free. I've also tried their ramen but have just decided to stick with their burgers. I really don't like paying almost 14 bucks for a burger but this is truly worth it and can't eat a regular burger anymore.
1972	0	First time at restaurant and got a deal for dinner on Groupon for $65.00. I made reservations for 7:15. We got to the restaurant at 7:05 checked in with the front and they told me it would be about 10 minutes. No problem we went and walked out in front entrance for there was no seating inside but stood by the entrance. We had been waiting for about 15 minutes and walked back to check if they had our table. The front desk asked me for my name again and said have a seat. About another 15 min go by and they finally called our name and the host had told me they called my name already and another guest had taken our reservation and was seated. No big deal it happens. We waited almost 10 minutes for a server to come to our table. He just took our drink order and walked away. We sat there not knowing what to do here and how it worked. He finally came back after a long time had passed with our drinks and explained what we were to do. Salad bar was very delicious but I was not too happy about the meat carvers. We only had 4 to 5 different carvers to table and 2 was the same meat. We has one serving of shrimp/salmon and one serving of pineapple. We were there for an hour and a half from time of checking in and eating. I would never pay full price for this place for customer service is terrible. The salmon was absolutely terrible. I would never recommend this place to anyone.
1349	0	Have you ever had to eat trash and have to pay for it ? Well this is the spot if you know Mexican food or Born Mexican you will know the food here is horrible by just looking at the prices. The food is pathetic the prices are insane 15 dollars for chips and guacamole come on man . Who spends 5 dollars on a "gourmet" taco it should be gourtrash it's nothing special please do not step in here I should've went to the Golden Arches and had a gourmet Big Mac
1357	1	I am a big Vegas fan and have been there more than I have places around where I live. I do not eat red meat or pork as I have mentioned before so I thrive on turkey burgers.  Finding a good turkey burger is a pretty hard thing to do, let me tell you. Most are frozen patty's that taste like cardboard.  Burger bar is situated inside of the amazing hotel/casino Mandalay Bay and is a great spot to hang out with some friends and have a couple drinks with your meal.  It is a neat menu where you choose everything you want from your burger with the type of bun and what you want on top.  Like I said I always get the turkey burger and it is a very good size, and juicy not dry like many others.  The downfalls are that you have to pay for each individual topping and the sides that you want with it.  You have your choice of fat steak fries, skinny fries, zucchini fries (my favorite) and some others.  I have a hard time choosing between the three so every time I go I usually rotate them.  I have never had a bad experience with the food nor the service.  The atmosphere is great (first of all its Vegas!). I love hockey so during the winter months they usually have a game on with their many TVs (located in every booth and some overhead at the bar), They have a full bar and some good beers on tap (blue moon always a fave).  I love it here and every time I go to Vega$ which has been happening a lot I have to go at least once if not more.  They are opened late (I believe 2am on the weekends) so when you are fed up at losing at the casinos, or drunk from gambling too much at the tables,  come here and give it a try!
1694	0	Went there for breakfast... Big mistake   They claim to have different stations of mexican american Chinese, mid eastern and italian.  And in each station they had the same shit. Not to mention that the mexican section was closed. The quality of food oh mann...re cooked/rebaked/old greasy food... 44$ for 2 ppl dennys wouldve been better-we want our money back!!
1095	1	Dear Secret Pizza,  Everytime I visit you I think of you for weeks after; and long for a pizza to live up to your amazing-ness here at home in the bay area.  it doesn't matter how long the line is- this is the best pizza on the strip and its 100% worth the wait; the hype is real; there is no struggle, just grab a beer and wait in line.  the white pizza- is unforgettable nomnom
1812	1	Fancy burger joints are part of the Vegas scene these days.  One, in particular, is known not only for its gourmet burgers w/ an Asian twist, but also for its local ties:  Bachi Burger.  Owner & Food/Beverage Director, Lorin Watada, is a transplanted local (Iolani grad) who now lives in Vegas. His cooking stints included Alan Wong's, Sheraton Hotels, Kahala Mandarin Hotel, & some 7  1/2 years as Corporate Chef w/ Roy's Restaurants, before opening  2 successful Bachi Burger locations in Vegas. The 1st location, just south of the Strip, opened in May 2010 in what was formerly a Dunkin' Donuts location in Windmill Plaza; the 2nd location opened in April 2012 in Summerlin, western Las Vegas. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=fIhDPCnCFfkcOHHi-jOJ3Q   Having local ties, it is then not a surprise that the reasonably-priced burgers & food are prepared w/ Pacific Rim/Asian influences. Quality burgers are made from Wagyu & Angus beef (price range from $7.50 for an Angus beef burger to $26 for Wagyu beef/foie gras); steamed sandwiches (Peking duck in bao, pork belly); fish sandwiches; & even a Vietnamese "ban-mi" sandwich.  The sandwiches are served w/ Asian-inspired flavors & ingredients commonly found in Hawaii, e.g., miso goma dressing, shiitake, kalbi marinade, kimchee, furikake, lemongrass, hoisin mayo, mizuna, lup chong, unagi, & others. There are also appetizers & salads, w/ one of their popular dishes being the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries served with chili aioli & a fried egg. As much as possible, ingredients are natural, organic, & sourced locally.    We loved the delicious burgers, as the flavors of the various ingredients just complemented each other. We had:  - Miyagi-san Grass Fed Wagyu Burger ($13.50). Came w/ chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, carmelized bacon, crispy onion rings.  There was no way you could eat this burger, or any of the other burgers, w/ the sandwich in your hand. I had to slowly dissect it to make it smaller; the onion rings were perfect crispy w/ a flavorful batter. The Wagyu beef just melted in my mouth & was so delicious w/ the egg, bacon, & furikake. The hamburger bun was also a winner - fresh Taiwanese sweet bun that is rich, buttery, & chewy w/ a nice shiny glaze on it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=ca3W5wdhrSem8ERFXnjI3g    - Spicy Miso Burger ($10.50). Came w/ red onion, Shishito pepper, mayo, lettuce, roasted garlic, cheese, fried egg, apple vinaigrette. Lots of flavor in this slightly spicy burger from the sweet, green, &slightly spicy Shishito peppers; bold & salty flavors from the miso; & a sweet, tangy oil/vinegar flavor from the vinaigrette. The same Taiwanese bun was used to make it even more flavorful. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=6pgTs0isXtKI5nXRLSfe3g   - Salt & Pepper French Fries ($4). Garnished w/ slices of hot Jalapeno peppers, Maui onion sea salt, & garlic chili aioli & served in a classy stainless steel cone. Thin fries that are perfectly fried, crisp on the outside & moist on the inside, & seasoned perfectly.  The aioli was perfectly spiced & creamy for easy dipping; we also enjoyed dipping them in a tasty pineapple-tomato ketchup. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=I6fySTopYSja57efTht35w   The restaurant's name, "Bachi," takes on a dual meaning:  a shortened version of the word "hibachi" which is a style of grilling; & a Japanese term meaning karma, i.e., to treat others how you would like to be treated & implied in a negative way. (I assume the name is more in line with the grilling aspect rather than negative karma.)  Service was adequate for this clean, contemporary 75-seat restaurant w/ exposed pipes on the ceiling to give the dcor an industrial look. There are stylish recessed & track ceiling lights hovering over classy dark wood tables. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=KJAhWE22AH5ShHamqwWWOQ   Bachi Burger was featured on the Food Network on Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives w/ Guy Fieri. This stint has helped to generate the crowds that it has been attracting.  I would love to return to try their other burgers/sandwiches/sides. Hawaii residents will love the Asian twist to these burgers/sandwiches, as the ingredients are all too familiar here.  A must-do for Hawaii residents traveling to Vegas or better yet, maybe a Bachi Burger in Hawaii?
1077	0	So i went to this place for my birthday... my expectations were set high and sadly it did not meet. I assumed the meals would be large in portions and the prices to me neutral but was the complete opposite. The food was not that good especially for the prices. I did enjoy the decor though! ALSO the "frozen hot chocolate" was a let down i expected different.
1237	0	If you're planning on paying for a buffet on the Strip, allow me to convince you otherwise, because it is definitely not worth it. However, if you find yourself with some complementary buffet vouchers, let the Wycliff flow! Most of the food here is standard buffet, which is to say, bad, but there are some palatable items to be had if you look carefully enough. I went with the gyros, available near the salad bar. Also acceptable-looking were the salads themselves. For dessert, I hunkered down for some frozen instant pudding (or gelato, as they call it around these parts), which tasted good enough. As an aside, I noticed a lot of people putting their faith in the raw bar here, and I haven't heard news of a salmonella outbreak, so that's something. Sparkling wine is complementary, so drink up!
1580	0	I love this restaurant and especially their wonderful to-go counter.  The hostess always greet and are very polite as well as the counter staff. On several occasions the manager working named Margaret or Marjorie (not sure but she works morning and afternoon) has been extremely rude and unfriendly. She doesn't smile or make eye contact with anyone and looks miserable. It's very sad to see someone dislike their job as much as she does and I'm sure her employees pick up on it. Hire someone friendly they are supposed to turn around bad experiences not create them.
305	0	Worst nightclub ever. I was trying to leave when in dark stairwell was attacked by a bouncer. I fought to get free from him. Very scary experience. Did police report all night & nobody cared. Had bruises all over arms & chest. Never heard from nightclub or police again.
510	0	The only reason I'm giving this place one star is because if i have it a ZERO my comments wouldn't get posted. I made my reservations 7 months in advance for a room with two queen beds. I called the hotel 3 days prior to my trip and confirmed my reservation, one room with two queen beds with a person at the front desk. When I arrived, I was told my reservation was for one King size bed. When I tried to explain to them that was incorrect, they told me I must have made the error while booking the room.   There were six people in our party and we individually booked three rooms with two queen beds for the same night. At check in, all six of us were told our reservations were for rooms with a single king bed. Although they brought up a roll away bed, no other compensation was given for their obvious booking error.   I asked to speak to a manager but no one was available. They took my name and number and to this day, no one from the hotel has called back. Do yourself a favor and stay at a Motel 6
157	0	Our group ate a predetermined BBQ meal consisting of chicken, beef rib, beans, corn on the cob, salad, and a roll. Paula Deen would be proud. Much of the food I had in AZ was piss poor. I was hoping to order off the menu which I assume has got to be better. The view isn't all that great either. What is there to look at? The buildings downtown waaaay off in the distance?  The urinals(2) in the men's room are placed right next to each other almost like it's designed for siamese twins to pee in. There is no divider. What a joy to have some idiot step up and piss that close to me. I could only picture there being splatter all over my jacket & pants. Ugh, what an ordeal.
161	0	I've been to Tao about 6 times in the past 2.5 years and I've always wondered...what is the big deal?  Yes, the venue itself is pretty sweet...but pack it in with hundreds of sweaty people? Not so crazy about it.  The first time I came to Tao, I had a blast. The second time was great as well, and it just manages to go down hill from there.  The club is large and has several levels, a huge dance floor and a few different rooms to explore.  Not to mention Tao Beach that they managed to slap on the last couple of years.  It ended up just being an extra line to stand in getting in and out of Tao Beach.  Tao, to me, is an overrated, over-crowded club that isn't worth the hassle.  There are TONS of promoters for the club...and if you manage to walk around the Venetian during the day without getting hassled by one, I'll give you $1.  I think the endless lines and lists and eager club goers to get into this club is because of the promoters and the name itself.  So bravo! The people over at Tao accomplished what they were going for.  However, aside from the cool Asian-influenced decor and the HOT rose petal girls sitting in bath tubs, nothing else makes the club super worthwhile.  The crowd is about a B to B+, though the more people they let in, the scale starts to slide down a little.  Who would I recommend the club to? Co-workers I don't like.  It's just way too damn crowded.
1537	1	The spicy tuna kimbab was probably what life is supposed to be (i loved it) the service was quick and the selection while not massive, is still accommodating beer selection is quick and to the point and gives you the best selections from a few different regions all in all a great experience.
757	1	THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!  I was in Vegas and decided to try this place and the burgers are amazing.  I had to go back again before we left Vegas (we never eat the same place twice).  This place is worth it.  I would go back to Vegas just to have these burgers and I am not even a Burger person.
151	0	Do not stay here! The room was so disgusting that I could not even spend the night. There were stains all over the carpet, it smelled musty/moldy, the bathroom was falling apart (i.e. the floor was missing pieces, the counter was stained, the shower was dirty), and on top of all of this the walls were paper thin! My fiance and I were only there 10 minutes before our neighbors arrived and we could hear their entire conversation. I understand not to expect much at the low rate they offer, but the fact that I couldn't even take my shoes off or was willing to put any of my belongings on the bed was enough to force me out of there. There are far better places to stay in Vegas!!
1213	1	Welcome to the Cheesecake Factory on steroids, dressed in expensive clothes, wearing $150 cologne, and driving a 2012 BMW 745li.  My girlfriend and I went to this place numerous times and it's no secret to any of our friends that this is one of our favorite places along the strip.  The food is decently priced, the drinks are expensive (it's the Strip after all), and the menu is ginormous.    I've never had a bad dish here.  Seriously.  And I've ordered all sorts of stuff on this menu.  The food portions are not for normal human beings, but for 9 foot tall giants who work out five hours a day.  If you like martinis then try the Calypso.
222	1	Hash House represents one "reel" of my foodie jackpot winnings in Vegas. Absolutely love this place!  During a mere 5 minute wait at 9ish am,  I checked out the celeb wall of fame. Man vs. Food's been here.  Impressive but more so, I loved the friendly attitude and commitment to customer service here.  Of course, the food was kickass and doled out in manly man sized servings. There must be a prereq to working here.  You must be fun and ubercool. There was no shortage of interesting tats and off the chart hair color.  Regardless, the hostess and the servers were really nice.   There was a literally a slight "mixup" in my oatmeal order but no biggie.  The server and the kitchen manager (?) were very considerate.   Yes, I actually ordered oatmeal despite being surrounded by foodie heavenly delights which were beckoning my name.  However, I resisted.  Well, no, actually, I did succumb to temptation and took a taste or two of hub's Fried Chicken eggs benedict.  Woman vs. food and food won. Now, this is no ordinary or traditional eggs benedict.  This was the kitchen sink gourmet version over yummy biscuits.  Each presented with a nice sharp knife on top of a huge pile of food.  How fitting.  My oatmeal was very satisfying with a pile of beautifully presented fruit on top. Think oatmeal... Carmen Miranda style.  Kiddo's pancake was the size of a Frisbee.  He ate a hole in the middle equivalent to 2 ordinary sized pancakes.   I know it's not "manly" to share dishes, but if you come in a group, it's too hard to not want to try someone else's entre, so I would recommend family style ordering.  The ambiance is laid back, modern and all walks of life come here.  Cool.... We'll def be back next time we're in town!!!!
1203	1	Oh! When I am sitting at home in New England, the Peppermill is what I dream of. Here's the deal.....the food is straight up Denny's. Only there is a TON of it. But who cares....toast your toes 'round the awesome water feature/gas jet in the Fireside Lounge. Order a giant Blue Hawaiian and admire the server's slinky, thigh-high slit evening gown. Zone out on the weird music videos on the little TV's.  Be hilarious and put three straws together to sip on someone's wacky drink across the way. And lighten up. This place is the last of a dying breed. The world today needs way more fake trees, mirrors, and awesome neon lighting.
1819	1	And here I am thinking that this place was a hidden gem. 82 reviews before me? I'm instantly flaccid. This is like finding out your favorite band is opening for Nickelback.  Ronin burger. Parmesan truffle fries. Lychee soda. Like --- total stomach erection.  Best part is that it's open late... it's going to give Naked Fish a run for its money as a late night poker hangout!
1567	1	My aunt and I came for Happy Hour and sat at the bar.   I ordered a Strawberry Mojito and she had a Mai Tai. Thank you very much Rachel for making mine perfect!  We also had the burger sliders with skinny fries and an order if fried chicken wings....also perfect!  The chicken and fries were nice and crispy and the sliders on Hawaiian bread, yummy!!!  Great choice we made!
1279	1	If you were only allowed to order two things at Bouchon, let those two things be their cheese danish and their french fries.  While having a lovely brunch at Bouchon on a Saturday morning (after I learned the hard way that they're not open for brunch on weekdays), I stuffed myself with their house french baguette, two different kinds of beignets, a cheese danish, waffles with strawberry and whip, THEN I proceeded to indulge in my boyfriend's plate of delicious french fries that came with his steak pomme frites.  My fingers and hand were stuck in a repetitive motion that circled from his plate to my mouth until his plate was virtually left with nothing but crumbs.  Now let's talk about their cheese danish.  If your mind is envisioning the flat cheese danish from your local starbucks, snap out of it.  Mr. Keller kicked it up ten notches when he created the flakey, muffin-size pastry dressed with a generous dollop of a decadent vanilla bean-cream cheese.  Pick one up from the Bouchon Bakery downstairs if you'd prefer to eat yours on the go.    Don't get me wrong... almost everything I tried was delicious.  But what sticks out in my mind a month and a half after my visit remains the cheese danish and fries.    The restaurant was filled with character and charm on a bright spring day atop the Venetian Tower.  Service staff was plentiful and friendly.
876	1	On a bachelorette party trip to Vegas, I think we ate every meal at Bouchon!  Must haves include:  Sourdough waffles-  Umm, why don't we have these in San Francisco?  I don't even like waffles. The vanilla bean butter made these feel like dessert.  French toast- dessert for breakfast.  Croque Madame- Amazing grilled cheese (it better be at $19). So good it is on the brunch and dinner menu.  Kir Royal- The best adult beverage of your life, blackcurrant champagne fizz  Warning: The coffee may cause you to found a new religion or branch of philosophy.  No matter how hung over, you will not be hanging out by the pool after a cup of this Joe!  For dinner,  Salude de Poulpe- I have a soft (not rubbery) spot for octopus.   Followed by Truite aux Almandes- picture almonds, lots of almonds, over a bed of  green beans and butter.    No dessert this time.    To make the weekend last for the rest of the week, I brought home Macaroons in neon colors.  Each one was  essence of pistachio, coffee, strawberry, lemon, vanilla or chocolate that melts in your mouth.  Perfect with my morning coffee.    Can't wait to go back.
783	1	What a fantastic place this is!!! I'm not just saying this as a HUGE fan of Gordon Ramsay, but I'm saying this as a burger monster!! My husband and I woke up after a late night in vegas, just to go stand in line to get a taste of Burgr and it was worth all of it!!! We started off with the roasted jalapeno poppers, which were served in individual little shot glasses with the sauce at the bottom. They were delicious. Definitely one of the best I've tasted. My husband ordered a cocktail, while I decided to go with the Shakes - Shake #1 which was a chocolate shake with caramel pudding (yes pudding!)... We ordered the uber cheese burger and the southern yardbird burger with a side of truffle parmesan fries. The burgers were cooked to perfection. The staff was friendly, efficient and helpful. All in all a five star experience and I will definitely go back there!
1254	1	Hash house has the best chicken and waffles.. My husband and I always take our friends here when they come in from out of town. No matter what time of day you go here the food is amazing and the portions are enormous... We always order our own food and take home 3/4 of our meal as that's how huge the portions are. If you're in town stop by here and order the chicken and waffles..
1743	1	Victoria was our server and she was AMAZING! i believe there was a "shift change" at the start of our meal and that was the best thing that could've happened. when our previous server said (verbatim) "what you drinking on?!?" i knew we were going to have problems. anyhow, Victoria more than made up for the ignorant server and the food (late breakfast) was quite tasty. ordered a few coffee's, scrambled eggs w/hashbrowns, sausage, bacon and OJ + to-go burger with fries :)
644	0	I was totally intrigued the first time I heard of frozen hot chocolate. How can it be frozen and hot?! Well.. after trying it out first hand, I conclude that it was a total waste of my $12 (for just a to go cup size)! It was simply a thick powdery super sweet cold chocolate drink! I rather have a glass of chocolate milk ):  I later found out that this other place called sugar factory also has frozen hot chocolate on their menu- for just $6-7. If any of my friends insist on trying it in the future, I would take them to this place instead. I wonder what big of a diff it will be.
848	0	During my first visit, I had the laksa and having tasted laksa in Singapore, I thought their serving was pretty good. So I had high hopes when I came back here for their other noodle dishes like wonton noodle soup. Unfortunately, it was mediocre and overpriced. The serving of noodles was not generous and the broth was sub par.   It took more than ten minutes for the order to be taken because the waiter seemed to be lost and not in the restaurant. However, when I asked for the bill, it came in snap.  I won't come back unless I wanted to satisfy a laksa craving.
1841	1	A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!! And we haven't even gotten to our food!!!! The banana nut muffin is EVERYTHING!!!! We also just got our food. Paula said everything on the menu is good and we just ordered 5 different plates and none disappoint!!!! Best way to start off our Vegas weekend!!!!! Paula is super awesome and so are all the staff!!! Ordering a loaf of banana bread for my toddler YUMMY YUMMY!!!! Thank you Egg & I
1261	1	i am a fan! too bad this place is in vegas.. very pricey but understandable.. they have a fried portabello mushroom inside the shack stack so you can see why they charge what they charge.. it's not just patty cheese veggies n bread.. they fancy.. you cannot compare this to in and out because they are different.. you can compare this to five guys and they totally kill em.. the shakes are weird though b/c it's just like in n  out.. not cold enough.. we also had the cheese fries.. YUM YUM! cant wait to get my hands on this place again
1611	1	I went to Vegas in January.  I ate here the majority of the time.  These burgers were the shit, dude!  Very fresh, and well prepared. I don't quite remember what I got on most of the burger. Can you blame me? My family came to Vegas before this time, and said this place was awesome. They did not lie.
477	1	A friend and I went here last night for the first time.  Completely blown away from start to finish!! Even the chairs (we noticed there were different ones available, depending on the table you were sat at. Ours were red leather.) were amazing!! The staff was so professional and knowledgeable about everything on the menu (your table is serviced by multiple staff members) and were "spot on" with there recommendations!!! The complementary breads served were absolutely delicious! We ordered the pork belly appetizer and were so impressed!! Definitely recommend that, if you go!!! For our main course, we ordered both the beef Wellington (how could you skip that??), and the Kobe filet with a butter poached lobster tail. Fingerling potatoes with truffles, and mac'n cheese, rounded off the meal. Ok...when a steak is so tender, your knife has difficulty cutting it because any pressure forces the meat to "surrender"....RIDICULOUS!!! Get the Kobe!!! Beef Wellington...amazing!! Both sides?....amazing!!! Portions, especially the lobster tail, seemed a bit small, but that worked out "famously," giving us "room" for dessert! All I can say is...the toffee pudding thing is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! I eat out A LOT, and this may have been the best restaurant experience I've ever had!!!
59	1	I'm thinking this is the cheapest thing you can buy here at the Cosmopolitan.   Another amazing recommendation from Kristen C. she said I had to try it after a long night of partying. It's $3-$5 dollars depending on the pizza and it's amazing!!! It's good when you're intoxicated and better when you're sober. It's a New York style pizza in Vegas!! Can't ask for anything better. I love a plain cheese pizza and this is one of the best cheese pizza I've had. Well worth my $3 and more. I also tried a white pizza with garlic parmesan, ricotta and mozzarella cheese YUMM.  I will say it's was a bit tricky to find, there isn't a sign outside and you have to walk through a dark hallway before seeing the pizzeria but if you can find it or flirt w/ a security guard to help you out (lol that's how I found it) then you'll be very happy when you do!!   Yummm, I'd love a slice right now!!
362	0	Wow, how the LA counterpart allows this place to keep using the Pink's name is beyond me.  The first time I went when it opened I was like meh.  The second time I went last month I was like wth!!!  I don't see this place lasting with it never having people there it seems.  The chili is pretty spot on to being the same as well as the dogs but man everything else is just horrible.  I mean I got a crusted tortilla wrapper that was litterarly cracking and breaking as if it was a cracker.  It's almost like they left the tortilla sitting on the counter all night and decided to use it anyways.  I mean if you are going to bring a prized LA landmark like this to LA then do it right.  I mean In-N-Out and Tommy's do it right.  It's just a downright shame for Pink's.
509	1	Offering a sizable length of rope is a dangerous thing, especially when a high percentage of your clientele will hang themselves with it. At Burger Bar, the rope is a massive number of options for each and every component of your burger. That's thousands of burger permutations, many of which are truly awful.   Vegas is great for people watching and Burger Bar is great for burger watching: take note as Lance from Des Moines constructs his demon spawn burger and then complains about the resulting assault on his palette.   You'll also notice those deer-in-the-headlights expressions when patrons first get a look at the number of menu offerings. The Burger Bar staff will not jump-in with recommendations. Do not be surprised by this. They don't eat there. It is just not possible. They're all amazing fit.   Anyway, 5 stars for this combo: *  1/2 pound Angus Beef, medium rare * Whole Wheat bun * Sauted Mushrooms * Caramelized Onions * Blue Cheese  The Burger Bar beer menu is huge with many beers on tap, so pair your burger with a cold one and some thick cut fries.
1120	0	Maybe this place and I got off on the wrong foot, the rooms are ok the ac cranks pretty well, they have nice flatscreens and the shower puts out hot water.    Unfortunately it is a bargain hotel so you do get some "interesting" folks in the elevator en route to your room.    If you book the resort things get a little nicer, they have an exclusive (using the term lightly) lounge, give you free wi fi and even have complimentary wine and beer during the evening hours.    Thats where the upside ends,  The pool is incredibly small and shaped weird, the drinks are watered down and the dining is laughable.  I tried to get a bite to eat and ended up having to go to 3 places before I could find a decent meal to go.  First I went to Tres Rios, The Vince Niel Place, and learned that the actual kitchen has been closed for 18 months and they only do happy hour drinks and appetizers, Literally thats all they open for, then I try to go to the Benihana garden and hit up the sushi bar they have in there to grab a few rolls for my wife and I and learn they are CLOSED FOR THE SUMMER, finally I have to go the cafe and order a boring grilled chicken sandwich.  I would have gone to another casino but I had my kid and my wife waiting for me upstairs.  Who closes a Mexican food joint with a celebrity owner and a Sushi place in Vegas??    The only reason this place gets 2 stars is because the rooms are alright and they give free soft drinks, beer and wine for the resort club members.  If you stay here thats fine but dont expect to spend any other time/money here other than sleeping and re hydrating after the partying you did the night before.    If I can avoid coming here again I will.
1549	0	Oh man... DON'T get me started with TAO night club. ARGH, so I came here with 5 girls total to TAO waiting for the rest of our bachelorette party.  2 of the girls parted ways after only 10 mins of being there and then there was 3. The 3 of us started drinking at the bar/restaurant area first before we went back up to the main club. Once in, it was PACKED... I mean you're lucky if there are tiny spots where you can BREATHE a little and have some room, but other than that, NO ROOM!  The main dance floor area WAS PACKED. SO PACKED that it was unbearable because you couldn't dance...   Bouncers there were rude and kept belly bumpin me thinking I was going to go under the velvet ropes to a table... which I wasn't ... argh all in all. I really don't like TAO NIGHT CLUB! I wished I was able to go to a better "EDM"-ish night club during my stay in Vegas, but I didn't have enough time to do that... Only upside was that Cash Cash was playing on the weekend of 7/26 so that was nice...   Other than that, I don't think I'll be returning to TAO!
1211	0	Nothing special.  Just like other mentioned, they are like Denny's happened to be at the Bellagio.  If you are Denny's kind of person, this is a place for you but be ready to pay Bellagio price.   They prioritize seating for Mlife members but not for the hotel guests.  You will be asked to be in the same line with bunch of other random tourists just visiting for the conservatory.  Noisy!!  You are expected to get fed and go.   If you are staying at Bellagio, go to the Pool cafe which only opens for the hotel guests.  They are soooo much better than this Denny's.
322	1	Bouchon is a great place to enjoy brunch after the crazy nights of debauchery in Sin City.  I've visited this restaraunt twice and was pleased both times.  The chicken and waffles as simply as I would put it, is the must try.  Bacon in your gravy? No Way!  Chicken was done magnificently with the right crisp and texture.  Definitely would visit again when in Vegas.
1959	0	Worse wait I've experienced.  Most people who spend money on the strip are people on vacation.  I don't know about you, but I don't like wasting my vacation standing around.  There was a coupon for a free frozen hot chocolate with the purchase of an entree, so I went to check it out.  I've seen pictures, and it looked so large and delicious.  Turns out, there was an hour wait to be seated.  I opted to forgo the coupon, and stand at the walk-thru window instead.  Horrible decision.  There were two parties ahead of me, but there were only two workers, so they took the order, made the order, then served the next customer.  The wait took over a HOUR.  I've never had such a horrible wait.    When I got the frozen hot chocolate, I ordered the one for 2.  It didn't look as large in a dinky plastic cup.  In fact, they only put about 2/3s of what they put in the blender in my cup.  The hot chocolate was good, but it wasn't worth the price.  It tasted cheap, like powdered hot chocolate, and blended ice.  I've tasted better frozen hot chocolates, and they are generally made with syrup, for a creamier more integrated flavor.  Overall, I was disappointed with my experience.  It doesn't taste bad, and the decor was interesting, so I give it a 2/5
325	1	This restaurant blew me away!  Everything was presented well and tasted just as amazing.  Being a Masterchef fan, I had to come to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and experience what he is all about.  I saw the kids on Masterchef Junior cook the famous beef wellington and had to have me some myself.  I immediately booked a reservation for my family on Thanksgiving.  A holiday will gave me a justified reason to be completely gluttonous and gorge to the max.  First off, Steak is located in the Paris hotel.  Just look for the big red sign.  At the hostess desk you will check in, and grab some cool matches :)  You are then seated in the bar to wait for your table.  We were then escorted upstairs to a cool booth with a great view over the entire restaurant.    When you are ordering the waiter will bring over a table with every cut of steak they serve and describe the marbling, texture, and flavor of each piece.   The bread plate is pretty darn good!  The two flavors of the pinwheel rolls (truffle and fig + bacon) are both amazing.  It is like a savory pastry that melts in your mouth.  The other breads were good as well, but the pinwheels are the winners.  The butter is served with black volcanic salt which adds a nice smoky saltiness to the butter.  I got the Beef Wellington which is served rare-medium rare (this cannot be changed due to the way that it is cooked).  The Wellington was so soft and juicy I was in love.  The truffle and prosciutto around the filet mignon was tasty and the pastry around was super buttery and flaky.  So good.  My brother got the short rib which fell completely off the bone.  My parents shared a rib eye because they both have hypertension, elevated cholesterol, and heart issues that they don't want to die of.  The rib eye was sufficient for both of them to share.  The restaurant even cut it into slices to make sharing easier for them.    For the sides we all shared the macaroni and cheese, sauteed mushrooms, and fully loaded baked potato.  The sauteed mushrooms had a nice woodsy feel to it and the mac and cheese was great.  It has blue cheese in it, which surprisingly did not overpower the dish.  For dessert we shared 2 sticky toffee cakes!   I would have devoured it faster if I wasn't so fully of steak.  This is their most popular dessert and I can see why.  They pour the toffee sauce right over the cake when it comes to the table.  The cake itself is light and fluffy and the sauce is just heaven.  The salted caramel ice cream comes in a rectangle form, so it looks like a stick of butter.  It was a little bit salty for me and I would have preferred straight vanilla ice cream instead but it was all good overall.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to spend a lot on a good steak dinner.  The quality of the food matches the price.  It was definitely one of my favorite dining experiences in Vegas so far.   Notes: - Use your Total Rewards card to get a few bucks off everything you order. - Make a reservation. - Enjoy everrrythangg!
361	1	Great Pizza. Great concept. For a hotel that builds its brand off of opulence and grandiosity. Its good to know that the Cosmopolitan isn't without a sense of humor or irony.  To find the joint,  just go down the out of place white tile hallway with crappy florescent lighting, you'll arrive in a room the size of a shoebox serving some of the best pizza I've had in recent memory.   Great food, great concept. Well done Cosmopolitan. It looks like management has a few risk takers.
1516	0	The absolute worse breakfast I've ever been served. Greasy hash browns, gross pancakes that tasted like they forgot to mix the bisquick batter and the most bitter cup of coffee I've ever had. All for the low price of $25, what a joke. Also I could not get the waitresses attention and she didn't come back to my table for 20 minutes. When I told her I almost did a spit take when I tasted the coffee. She took the cup and came back 10 minutes later with the same bitter brew. If you want bad food and bad service this is the place for you. I can't believe food this awful would be allowed in Mandalay Bay. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!
1226	1	Highly recommend getting there before they open at 5:30pm. We got there at 5:15pm and sat in the car, then slowly a line of people started to form. We literally got a table when they open at 5:30pm. Service was amazingly quick and attentive. The food arrived within 5 to 10minutes. The price is on the higher end for Thai food- average about $15 to $30 for entree, but it's well worth it. The menu is very extensive and it's sorted by the region of Thailand.    The garlic prawn comes with 8 generous pieces and flash fried with garlic seasoning. It was delicious and the shrimp was crispy. The prawn was deshelled therefore consumption is very convenient.   The crispy duck with the noodle was one of my favorite. The duck was tasty with a crispy skin. The flat rice noodle was slightly pan fried and complimented the duck really well. Pretty much, it's  similar to the Chinese chow fun (pan fried rice noodle) atop with crispy duck.   The Thum ka noon was minced pork with jackfruit. We randomly ordered this and it was interesting. It would be really good if it's eaten with rice. Overall, the food was very well seasoned and I cant stop burping after the dinner. I will definitely come back and try different entree. I'm curious how good a simple pad thai or pad see ew would taste in here?
270	1	Had breakfast at Bouchon after finally finding the place in the terribly confusing Venetian (and we've been to the casino many times).  My wife had the waffles with strawberries and vanilla syrup.  I had the sourdough French toast with bread pudding.  This was the best breakfast we have ever had bar none!  What we cook at home as waffles and French toast seem like totally different foods!  Service was good though perhaps a bit stiff.  No real issue though.
1561	1	LOVE this place.  Went for brunch on a Saturday around 11am, only had to wait a couple of minutes while a table was cleaned.  Everyone who works there was terribly nice, and we loved the little egg sign that tells the staff if you need something. You must order the stuffed French toast!!  I'm not normally a French toast eater, but this is not normal French toast!  SO yummy, like the best sweet and hearty sandwich I've ever had - I could only get through half of it.  My friend had the eggs plus, which looked yummy, and a banana nut muffin that everyone raves about - it was awesome.  Their ranch potatoes are also amazing, like eating tiny square-shaped french fries. Everything is so well-priced.  We paid $26 including tip for both of us, and considering I had an orange juice, I'd say that's pretty great.
1984	0	Instead of getting the King size bed we had requested when we paid our room deposit, we got stuck with two full size beds which were too small. Our room was located in another building, which they failed to mention. We were not given any map of where the room was located, how to get to it, or any of the amenities. The room smelled like a nursing home, the shower was tiny, and the bathroom sink had hairs in it. I will not return to this hotel.
458	0	This was a disappointment.  Everything looked good, but when I tried it, all the food on my plate was cold (pasta, fish, etc.).  I ended up eating nothing but the crab legs and mussels because they were okay cold.  It was odd because the crab plate was steaming.  Eventually I figured out that if I dug crab legs out from the bottom of the pile and avoided the legs on top they'd be warm, but by then I was pretty full.  Like all the other buffets we tried in Vegas, they expect you to tip before you are even seated.  If you don't want to give a gratuity for service you have not received and you don't carry cash, the only option you have is to stiff the server.
1569	1	We came here after reading the reviews and it was amazing! The place is clean. Service was good and quick. But most of all, the food was so flavorful!!! You've got to try this place! Amazing food with a huge menu which we can't wait to try next time.  Service was great and we were glad we can early on. Saturday as the place started to fill up.  Definitely recommended and now a favorite going forward when in Vegas!
938	0	Absolutely worst buffet I've been to. Also extremely overpriced at about $40 per person. I was issued a  $100 food and beverage credit because MGM messed up our room so I'm glad I didn't have to pay my own money. I'd prefer Golden Corral any day. This buffet is lacking flavor and variety
166	0	Quite fair.  For reference - I've been to several other churrascarias - from Boston, MA to Nairobi, Kenya.  I came in alone killing some time and needing a quick lunch while out in Vegas for a conference.  To be frank, the food quality at Pampas just kind of lacks.  The salad bar was mostly bland and ill-prepared or overcooked.  The service was fine, but sometimes awkward and at times brusk.  I attend my conference annually and won't be back to Pampas next year.
755	1	I took my girlfriend here for our one year anniversary last night. It was my first time there, but I had always heard great things about this place, so I figured I'd share this as another first with my girl and I'm glad I made that decision. There's a lounge where you can just sit and have a drink by the fire (the drinks were awesome!) And the cocktail waitresses were so nice. After a few drinks, we walked over to the dining room, which had a 50's retro feel. Our server Samantha was so nice. If you're looking for a nice place to go to for chorizo and eggs, pancakes, or any other feel-good food, come down to this place and enjoy!!
250	0	Good valet service.  Front desk service is horrific...especially a person named Del who argues and hangs up the phone on guests.  Bell service is terrible, they lost my bag.  It is unbelievable to me how a bag can be lost from the car to the room.  However, the Raiding the Rock Vault Show is awesome, the LVH is lucky to have it.  Having stayed there two times now, the rooms are very gross, and I had the nicest suite you could have.  The carpet is so disgusting....they brought it over from a hotel across the street.  I was told from an employee who has been there for 30 years.  They are owned right now by Goldman Sachs, and are hoping that someone buys them.  The furniture is old and disgusting.  I wonder how this hotel stays alive with all the new, shiny hotels that are available to stay at.  And the employees are not even nice.  If they were, it might make up for the poor hotel conditions.
257	0	MEEEH. I really really really used to love Tao. I went last weekend and my eyes were opened to its overratedness. Don't get me wrong, its a great venue but it definitely has is flaws.   The Venue - Freakin awesome. When all is said and done, you have three levels. On the first level you have the lounge with a ton of couches and a big bar. Not many people dancing though - you also do not need to pay cover to get in here. The next level is the main club level with two separate rooms. One plays hip hop and the smaller plays "Dance". There are bars on every side. Last but not least, Tao Beach is upstairs. Seating, heat lamps, big bar, POOL - its all there. There is also so great decor - YES I DO MEAN BATH TUBS.   So that was the good, onto the bad:   The line. WOW. I get that this is a hot spot in Vegas but the line gets nuts. I have seen it wrap and twist around around the whole outside area. There is an easy fix to this - go have dinner in the amazing restaurant and get a "line pass" stamp at the end of your meal. It will fill you up, save you some time and cut the cost of cover!   The bars - can you say freakin expensive for not the greatest value. Yessir, my Henn was $16. I'm not even a Henn guy and it was still $16. LOL If your a dude, you also have to find a female bartender cause the guys will barely come talk to you if there is any type of crowd around. I almost had to flash a little areola to get a drink.   The space - yes this may be the biggest club I have ever been to but it is too effing packed. Like so packed you can't have fun. It amazes me that there aren't a ton of fights in here. I had no room to dance and less room to even walk. Tao Beach is cool upstairs but its COLD in November.   As nice as the club is, there are too many cons and spots where its easier to have more fun in Vegas.
360	0	I've been to the Mandalay Bay Buffet many times, and the quality has definitely gone down over time.  My favorite is always the prime rib when it's cooked just right at medium rare.  The crab legs are good, but they are not normally fresh and the shells are soft which makes them really hard to open to get that one piece of meat.  I remembered their dessert used to be better also, though their bread pudding is still very delicious and about the only dessert I eat there now.
1660	1	I first discovered Shake Shack via The Message is Medium Rare. Being well over 2500 miles from the nearest location was heartbreaking. When I discovered there was not only one in Vegas, but one in NYNY, where I was staying, was a dream come true.  I ate here all three days of our trip. I had three different burgers. I fell in love.  The Smokeshack was my least favorite of the burgers. Bacon always feels like an unwanted after thought on burgers and even though they tried to balance it with acidic peppers it was still lack luster. The Shackburger is a perfect representation of a classic burger. The soft bun melts away, the burger has a crisp skin and tastes of steak, the toppings are in perfect harmony. The crown jewel of Shake Shack is the Shackmeister burger. Topped with their delicious fried shallots, cheese, and shack sauce. Perfection. Their Fries are deceiving, they look like crappy school lunch fries but they are crisp on the outside and pillowy soft inside. Cover them with cheese sauce because you are in Vegas!  They also serve beer here and no matter what we ordered we were always undercharged for the beer. I guess it was out lucky day.
1015	0	Okay I have been coming here on and off for five years.My kids remember the atmosphere and what was awesome food and great steaks. Wait a minute did I say great steaks.?  What the heck has happened.?The last two times I have been here since a few years ago have really changed things. I could not even cut my steak. Neither could my son who travelled all the way from Montana to revisit his memories of the roost.  And c'mon guys no cotton candy for the kiddies on the Fourth of July. Well I paid for the steak but won't be spending any money here for a long long time.
1920	0	Well well well i realize its opening day and it went pretty well for a 2 1/2 hour wait in line and 33 mins to get our food.... All was hood except the smokers who didnt care and at the very end of what could have been at least 4 stars... Riley at the door was belligerent to me when i came back in to get my daughter who was waiting on the food.... Too bad with the prices SO high, the novelty is a 80 cent burger they are 1.59 with cheese. Really guys? You wont make enough? This is a great way to run off your locals, trust me, youll regret it!
1316	1	This is one of my best meals in Vegas! I have never experienced real Thai food until now. Normally I would have settled for the usual pad thai and pad see ew. However, I wanted to be adventurous this time. I tried the nam kao tod as an appetizer, and it was AMAZING - the crispy rice with the pork sausages, lime juice, chili, and green onions make my mouth water. Hands down, the best Thai dish ever!!! I even looked up recipes online to try to replicate this dish at home.   We also tried the garlic prawns that were deep fried; the dish was deliciously crunchy. Our third dish was the crispy duck in Khao Soi (thai egg noodles in a curry sauce). The crispy duck was yummy, but got a little soggy in the Khao Soi. It would have been slightly better if the crispy duck was separated from the Khao Soi, and combined the two later to maintain the crispness in the duck.   The menu is quite extensive. My boyfriend and I were quite overwhelmed. We could only fit in three dishes between the two of us. I would highly recommend this place. You'd be really missing out if you don't give it a shot!   Service was friendly and fast.   There is plenty of parking in the plaza.

I have been there before and it wasn't that good so i thought maybe they were having an off day but it seems that's standard operating procedure.  We had the beef brisket noodle soup and it was awful. The beef was 3 chunks of boney fatty I don't even want to call it beef that would be an insult to the cow. The soup was cold! It's a noodle company according to the name and they can't even warm up the soup?!  For $16 I could of eaten an entire smorgasbord in Chinatown for that price. I also had the red bean bun and it was the worst red bean bun I have ever had.  You can go into Chinatown and have dim sum and get the best red bean buns at Orchid Garden.  If I was from Beijing I would be insulted that they were trying to pass this off as something from there.  It was very disappointing.  I guess I'm gonna have to go to Chinatown to get a descent bowl of noodles and hand made red bean buns.

Lobby is smokey (but this is Vegas, baby). Pool/spa area are decent. Public areas are clean, but I found rice cracker pieces under the ottoman in my room after I checked in ... tisk, tisk.
1960	1	This place is seriously on my top five places I most love and want to return to. I came here on the first night I finally went back to Vegas.   Everything from the atmosphere to the food, and service was just very on point.   The bar is so beautiful, very elongated and prestigious. The bartender was great, you can't really mess up a Black label on the rocks can you? Very impress with the design and set up.   The food here is so fudging good, I mean I was pretty tipsy but I remember the steak being so perfectly good. It melted in my mouth, I believe I had the bone-in-rib eye with the mac-cheese and spinach side to share with my best friend. Mac and cheese was exactly how it should be made, not extra cheesy but like enough to make the noodle saucy and still textured. Love the spinach sauteed with that parmesan cream. Yum! I am not too sure what he got, but remember trying it and was like damn that's bomb.   The service was really good, from the beginning to the end they were very accommodating and friendly. To my recollection.   I honestly love this place for so many reasons; mainly the conversations me and my bestest always share over bomb dinners, and just overall being totally overwhelm with happiness here.
1810	1	This restaurant is everything a restaurant should be.  Great food, great service, great value.  First, they made a simple omelette amazing wiht freshly roasted vegtables, home-made (real) hash brown potatoes and even a great bagel.  We each had a spicy bloody mary which was really amazing.  Lastly, we had the beignets as breakfast dessert.  The service was really great.  A very relaxed and enjoyable experience.  The rest of the menu looked great and can't wait to come back again soon.  Run don't wakl to Grand Lux Cafe.
144	0	one word - OVERRATED!  The fam bamz decided to come here for an afternoon snack.  We heard about the rave of the "Frozen Hot Chocolate" and wanted to find out what the hype was all about.  It was around 3pm and to be expected, the place was mad busy.  There was an hour and 1/2 wait for a party of 8.  There was plenty of outdoor tables and the weather was absolutely phenomenal during the month of March. We decided to try out their take out orders.  It's a limited menu but again, we were there strictly for dessert.  We were in line for 45 minutes.  I don't understand why there was a long wait when the orders consisted of ice cream.  I passed on the frozen hot chocolate - why do I need to spend $15 on a milkshake?  I went with the huge chocolate donut and the Forbidden Sundae which consisted of chocolate cake, chocolate and vanilla cream, whip cream, chocolate syrup, and a cherry on top.  I waited another 15 minutes for my order to be prepared.  I saw my sundae sitting on the counter underneath an air vent that was melting my ice cream. It took another 10 minutes for the server to grab my donut.  By the time I was handed my sundae, the whip cream turned into milk and spilled over the cheesy cup.  The cake was hard and chewy.  The ice cream underneath and had already turned into mush.  It was the MESSIEST sundae I have ever dealt with.  It was sooo messy, that it got me angry and I just wanted to throw it away! The donut was nothing special....just  big.  This was the worst experience ever! Everyone wants to eat here because of the movie; well, I'm hear to tell you that the service and food is below standard!  WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!  If you want real ice cream, come over to the bay area and hit up MITCHELL'S!  Mitchell's is worth standing in line for!
236	0	Honetly I came here at 3 in the morning (its a 24 hour location) and the line was ridiculous. Nothing but drunk people screaming at the workers and women with barely any clothes on walking around. I really felt as if I was in a nasty club with really bad lighting.   It took almost an hour to get my food, the workers looked tired, overworked, and unappreciated. I felt so bad people were yelling at them cursing them out saying mean things to them, It was really bad.   On top of that, I ordered the chicken rings and try were extremely dry and hard. The shake was about 7 dollars and not great. Overall I wont be coming back, but I hope that the people that work here can get a nice vacation some day because what they go through is atrocious.
1987	1	The food here is FANTASTIC. 5 stars, easily.  Calimari : 9 out of 5 stars I'm a stickler when it comes to calimari.. some may say I am on a Holy Grail of sorts-- in search for the PERFECT calimari. Here, it was perfect. Not too salty. Not chewy. And came with a flavorful and creamy sauce. I was in love.  Pasta: 5 stars Generous portion of meat, cheese and pasta with a zesty sauce.  Ambience: 5 stars High-end. Guilded walls. So much attention to details.   Truly an enjoyable experience. A personal favorite of mine!
1358	0	The staff here was awful! There was a huge line and four people just standing around not helping anyone. We even asked what the problem was and were informed that only one person was qualified to operate the register. Once we were seated, twenty minutes later with only a couple in front of us, the waitress we had was in a poor mood and not polite at all. I will say that the food was great, minus the American section, but it was quite pricy. The help at this restaurant definitely ruined the experience and we will not be returning.
1676	0	We were in Vegas last month, finishing our trip just as the bull riders convention was getting into town.  After a little poker win (we'll take it!) we wanted a little celebration.  Walking through the Excalibur we saw several signs that welcomed the bull riders and advertising $5 shots of Jack Daniels.  Sounded like just what the doctor ordered.  We ducked into Dick's Last Resort off the casino floor.  It's fun and funny--like Ed Debevic's in LA, the staff is faking rudeness, part of the schtick.    Here's what's NOT funny.  We ordered a shot and a beer.  Want a regular or a large ("Big Ass") beer?  Hey, we're celebrating and large, I thought, is always a better deal.  The bill came, and the $5 shot was $7.  What about the signs?  "We don't know anything about that."  The large beer was FOURTEEN DOLLARS.  Are you kidding?? The price wasn't listed anywhere on the bar, and the bartender never mentioned the price; I know I should have asked beforehand how much, but I NEVER would have thought it was that high.  When I asked, it was explained to me that I got to keep the "glass" (a cheapo plastic thing you might get at a picnic) and could get a great deal on refills:  EIGHT DOLLARS.  The prices are lower at the high end Cosmopolitan down the strip.  It's a rip off pure and simple.  Dick's and the Excalibur are betting people won't complain.  Wrong.  Just be warned, go somewhere else.
1191	0	Slow service! Party of 4, We sat at our table at 10:30 and didn't leave until 12:30am! Since we got there our waiter neglected our table. We missed the bellagio fountain shows. We had simple orders.He only checked on us once. Food came out slow and at that point hard to enjoy. He attended all other tables but ours. He never acknowledged the fact or apologized. By midnight we were fed UP. He brought us a dessert but never said why. We didn't get to walk around the strip early like we planned, all our activities were pushed back and we went home at 4am. We spent our ONE night stay at serendipity for TWO hours. Ridiculous. By the end we hated being there we just wanted to leave. The waiter was a total buzzkill. We didn't even finish the dessert that looked good cause we wanted to go see the rest of Vegas. Not going back!
341	0	My wife and I were seated by the hostess and literally as we were sitting down an angry lady stormed over and said our spot is a reserved spot. We looked back for the hostess, who was long gone and the angry lady basically said can't sit here so get out of here. We had to chase down a hostess who eventually put us back in the same spot. It was weird, embarrassing and rude.   The food was very small portions and expensive for what it is. With all the good restaurants around, choose another.
1305	1	This was our first time coming here, and let me tell you it won't be our last! This hidden gem is off the strip, but well worth the time. It's located in a strip mall and it's obviously a local favorite. I saw a massive line, and thought is it gonna be worth the wait?? It's not a fancy place, it's homy and comfortable with lots of tables, staff and commotion of the morning rush. We were a party of 9, and expected a wait, 25 was all we waited! Our waitress was awesome! She was very attentive, and offered us a FREE banana muffins that were bomb! She took our order, and offered us some wonderful suggestions! The time of truth, the food was awesome, fresh and hot! The portions were huge! I loved this place and will definitely come back each and every time am in Vegas!!
165	1	Slow service so have plenty of time. LOVE the food here. I recommend almond boba, the ronin burger, steamed buns, fish chips, and hot sake. My kind of night! Art on the wall is cool too. This place isn't for everyone. Seating is a little uncomfortable and you can here everyone else's dumb conversations. You also have to have a palate for this stuff. Also, hard to see from the street so keep your eyes peeled.
1422	0	My boyfriend and I had bought tickets at one of those half off ticket places and we asked where we should eat before the show, they recommended this place. The menu looked pretty good when we got there, so my hopes were high. We had potstickers as an appetizer (they tasted as though they had been in a freezer for way too long and they had been microwaved).... My Kobe beef hamburger which I order medium was completely burnt. All I could taste was burnt. Then my boyfriend, who ordered his steak medium rare said he didn't even think they cooked it. His asparagus was cold too. Only thing decent about this place was the French fries. And to top if off, our order took FOREVER! I think they forgot about us. The waitress even commented that it was taking sooooo long and said she would talk to her manager about comping half of our meal. The manager came out, and apologized...then they said they would give us a free dessert too because it took so long. We end up never getting dessert and they comped NOTHING for us. So basically, my recommendation would be never ever go here. The end.
1949	1	Hung over and tired of all the buffets and expensive overrated eateries on The Strip? Well...Hash House a Go Go might just be what you're looking for! It's located off The Strip, but it's a great place for breakfast and brunch.  I came here with a fairly large party and we were seated almost immediately. With a table full of foodies, we decided to order several dishes to share. This allowed us to try a little bit of everything, which was fantastic! Some of the dishes that we ordered included the following: HH Famous Meatloaf, Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, Corned Beef House Hash, Griddled French Toast, Roasted Pork Tenderloin, and Chicken and Waffles. My favorite was the Griddled French Toast; it was airy and fluffy, with a nice crisp at the edges. It included baked bananas drizzled with banana cinnamon cream and pecan maple syrup. The combination was absolutely orgasmic and I highly recommend it! Another dish that stood out was the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. The benedict came with sort of scrambled eggs, versus the typical poached egg that I am used to. It was different, but delicious. The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and the sauce was unique and flavorful.  The portions were humungous and very nicely presented. Their drinks are also a hit too--especially their kiwi watermelon lemonade and various mimosas! Our waitress was patient and courteous too, so don't forget to visit this place the next time you're in town!
1409	1	Definitely the place to enjoy late night food after clubbing at Marquee. The wait can be long and there isn't a readily available menu to see the pizza selections. The pinball and arcade games give it a vintage feel. The pizzas are similar to NY style pizza with large slices. Can't go wrong with the mushroom and cheese pizza. The pepperoni and sausage pizza was also delicious. FYI - The slices are about $7.50 each. Overall, a great place to sober up and enjoy late night food.
1455	0	This was not at all a good example of lavish Vegas buffets. Even if you're staying at the MGM Grand, I'd go elsewhere for a brunch on the Strip. At least it's not expensive, but having breakfast and lunch here felt far too much like being at a regular old restaurant somewhere in the midwest. (Which I would totally do in the midwest... it's just not what I flew to Vegas to eat!)  The food itself was okay, but there was nothing unusual, and a pretty paltry selection overall. I'm glad I ate here at the beginning of my stay so that I could be gradually more impressed as the weekend went on.
988	1	This is my second time visiting and it's awesome! I had the Hell's Kitchen burger cooked medium well.  Great choice if you like spicy food. It's really good! We also had the truffle Parmesan fries.....so good!! This time I had room for dessert and got Shake #3.... OMG so delicious. StafThe only thing is a downside is the wait other than that everything is good. I still give it 5 stars despite the wait!
1318	1	How can I not give 5 stars to the restaurant that warranted two trips in as many days?  Based on the mention of the mountain of fries (a million thanks, Monica), I insisted on getting a reservation for our first night in town; we snagged seats at the bar for dinner our second night.      The beef tongue salad was so good that a man at the next table asked what it was because the expression on my face made it evident that whatever I just put in my mouth was something very, very special.       Come to think of it, the food sparked conversations with three different couples at neighboring tables--makes me think of that Cat Stevens song:    Oh I can't keep it in, I can't keep it in, I've gotta let it out.  I've got to show the world, world's got to see, see all the love,love that's in me    Eat at Bouchon and try to contain yourself.
1645	0	From far away, this restaurant looks like it could be a fun place to grab a bite to eat. We were wrong, it is overpriced and has terrible food. We arrived and were seated right away outside on the patio, the windows were covered with dust and who knows what else. Although we were outside we had to scream to hear each other.  We ordered drinks and an appetizer of Chips and Salsa ($5!!) which were ok. It took about 30 minutes to receive them. I ordered a chimichanga and my girlfriend ordered a taco salad -- after a while it finally came. My chimichanga came soggy, and the plate was a mess, it looked as if they had spilled onto it. In fact, there was a french fry underneath the chimichanga. The rice was hard like it had been reheated and the overall taste was horrible. My girlfriends salad looked great but tasted like nothing, and the waitress who never returned also did not bring dressing. We left severely disappointed after paying a whopping $51 for a terrible meal and mediocre service.
1698	1	Absolutely incredible. Came here on a Wednesday night with my husband and had a phenomenal experience. We got there 30 minutes before our reservation time but they had no issues seating us.  SERVICE: Amazing. Our waiter was so knowledgable and he was perfectly attentive -- not too scarce and not too annoying. The steak presentation is amazing. Love it.  FOOD: First is the bread. It might as well be an appetizer -- they have a lemon rosemary bread, some bread with bacon, a walnut bread, etc and it's such a unique selection that you can't help but eat them all. For appetizer we ordered the 1/2 Dozen Oysters and they were so fresh and delicious. For dinner I ordered the Kobe Filet, hubby ordered the Signature Beef Wellington with a side of Bone Marrow and Fingerling Potatoes. Every single bite of every single entree was amazing. I very rarely am able to finish an entree but I polished off my 8 oz Filet which was so wonderfully tender and seasoned perfectly. My husbands Beef Wellington was perfectly balanced with the meat and pastry and cooked a perfect medium rare. The Bone Marrow was melt-in-your-mouth with great flavor. The Fingerling Potatoes were so good and I loved that you could taste both the parmesan and the truffle! I only wish we had saved room for dessert!  Will definitely be back!!
1197	0	This was my 4th time staying at this hotel for a convention next door and I will never go back!  The last 3 years I have been downgraded from the Grand Room to a crappy room and all they offer me is a smoking room when I have complained.  I don't know why they take reservations they are unable to fulfill. This year the lady at the front desk double talked me and said we have been upgraded from the Grand room to a resort club room for an extra $10 per night.  When we got up to the room, it turned out to be another crappy room.  I immediately called down to the front desk to complain but was told they sold out of Grand rooms.  They considered me upgraded because my room was supposed to have robes, slippers & a free bottle of water, NONE of which was in our room.  I was told to call housekeeping about getting those items sent up.  We were also given gold keys to another room on another floor, which apparently had food and drinks but only open limited hours so we never did have a chance to see that.  So, thats what they considered an "upgrade" and tried to charge me more for.  I ended up calling the manager the next day and they took $30 off but to me it wasn't worth it at all.   The room was supposedly updated but it looked the same as it did the last 4 years, broken lighted mirror and not vacuumed.   Bottom line is I will never go back!
1754	1	We came here earlier in the day and it was packed so we left. We came back later for dinner, around 6:00 and we got right in.  We split the sage fried chicken benedict and it was huge. I would definitly order it again, biscuits, eggs, gravy, mash potatoes and whatever else they throw in there.  I saw plenty of other dishes that the servers where passing out and i want to try those, like the chicken and waffles
310	1	This was by far the pinnacle of my dining experiences so far. We ordered the shrimp cocktail, which was very different from the norm but delicious and refreshing with the cucumber cocktail sauce. The shrimp were huge and meaty. We also ordered the American filet and the wellington. My friend likes her steak well done and even at that the filet was cooked so well that you could cut it with a fork. The wellington was delicious. The only thing I would do differently next time is for a light touch on the truffles. We split the mac and cheese as a side and, while it was very different, it was delicious.  The service was stellar. Our waiter Anthony took care of our every need and was so patient and knowledgeable about the menu. This was serious the best dining experience I've ever had. Money well spent and I'm glad I did it.
1883	0	By the way, the manager contacted me about a week after I posted this review. Said he wanted to make it right...blah, blah, blah. I responded and he NEVER contacted me again. With that kind of service and the amount of awesome restaurants in Vegas, their business has only one place to go...in the ground.
48	0	I came here mostly because I had a buy one get one free coupon for cocktails. The disclaimer says under 9 dollars... Too bad there are 0 cocktails for under 12 dollars so I just stuck with a water.   My girlfriend got a wet burrito and she ate just a bit because it was "way too dry". How does that happen with a wet burrito?   I ordered a BBQ pulled pork. It was the worst thing I've ever had in my life. It had drown in so much sweet BBQ sauce that chewing it down was almost torture. The sweet fries are on par with Applebee's. I was looking forward the corn on the cob for a nice crunch but it was actually soggy like it was dropped in a puddle. I've honestly never heard of soggy corn. Was this done on purpose? How do you mess up that bad?  The best part was watching some drunk kid sing karaoke from my sticky table.  Instead of going to the casino after, I just went up to my room.  I'm actually writing this from my toilet. Wish me luck.
342	0	The worst cafe food in Las Vegas. Seriously! $5 for a baked potato that has been sitting all day and barely reheated. The inside was light brown...possibly cooked the day before. The pork fried rice obviously had suggest in it. Steve's blood sugar skyrocketed to almost 300 after eating 1/4 of a bowl. I tasted it and told him to stop eating it immediately. I could taste the sugar. $40 later for rice and a potato.
199	1	While I base my culinary life on David G.'s teachings, I must have been there on a good night or had a little Vegas luck left over because I had an amazing experience! He's right- the place has pretty much nothing English about it and is a two story glass box, but I did like the welcome; upon approaching the Host desk, you are greeted by a half dozen Identical 6 foot tall brunettes in the same little black dress. I thought I'd wandered onto a Robert Palmer video set! (lf you haven't heard of him you betta ax somebody!). We were then escorted upstairs to a rail side table overlooking the bar and entrance areas as well as a spectacular  chandelier- type lighting fixture. Very well appointed room and tables.  WHEN YOU GO- We started with the gnocchi and fried oysters. Both were very good with the oysters being my favorite. Perfectly crisp and juicy at the same time, I could have had three plates of those and been very happy. I also had the filet, which was the best I've ever had and I've had a few steaks. I usually order either a rib eye or Porterhouse, but was advised to try the filet by our outstanding server Mathew. And he was right! Perfect medium rare, juicy and flavorful to the last bite, it was incredible. Wifey had the Wellington which was very good, but I found the sauce to be a little salty and the philo didn't stand up to it very well. Good flavor and the meat was perfectly done. We also had the toffee bread pudding and if I could change one thing about the meal it would have been that. I'm not much of a bread pudding fan but after Matthew's home run with the filet suggestion, I followed his lead on this one. Very sweet, and the bread was saturated to the point of nearly being mush. I'll be going for the apple tart next time (my wife wins again!). All in all a five star experience for me. Hope it is for you too!
120	1	I went for lunch. I got a pesto scramble and I have to say this was one of the best flavor combinations I've had in a while. There were eggs, pesto, whole spinach leaves, cheese, and I think some tomatoes scrabbled to fluffy perfection.  My fianc got the western omelette and he said it was the best he's ever had.   We bought a groupon at $24 for $40 worth of food so it was a good deal too, but I am definitely coming back in the future.
1530	1	5 stars is not enough!!!  Top tier level of service in a very comfortable atmosphere. The food was INCREDIBLE! The service was impeccable without being pretentious. As it should be, the teamwork that was involved throughout the night, is completely on point. The thoughtful features of not just pointing something out but, accompanying me, and covering the water as it's poured. The amazing manager (Tracy Gladson)  and wait team that took care of us made us feel like we weren't strangers.   You must order the Rib Cap, it is cooked perfectly. I don't have words to describe it other than melt in your mouth, perfect. I hope that all of Gorson Ramsays restaurants are this amazing, I will be eventually going to them all. He set the bar high and his team at Gordon Ramsay Steak leaped over.
1583	0	The location of this hotel is great, for the price, it was close to everything we wanted to do. However, the hotel is in a sad state of disrepair. The beds are uncomfortable and we paid over $20 a day resort fee to look out the window at a disgusting almost empty  mildew pool being renovated. All of the horrible pictures are correct. The elevators are terrifying, and one even closed when we came back from lunch. The casino is small and feels like a frat house, and the staff look bored and uninterested , but they are nice. You don't get lost here though and aren't a 30 minute walk from the room in the hotel. Which is nice. The rooms are relatively clean but don't expect anything  to work properly. The televisions are old tube tvs and are probably 15 years old but whatever. The food at Hooters was not great but the waitresses were ok. Don't expect anything and you won't be disappointed.
866	1	Best Thai food of your life unassumingly located in an off-Strip sketchy strip mall, with the accolades and photos with celebrities adorning the walls and full tables to prove it.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu; however the pad thai, crispy duck, and braised short rib with panang were standouts.
1746	1	We had dinner here at midnight. At that hour, you kind of expect mediocre service and food to kind of just get you by. This was one of the best burgers I've had. I had a turkey burger and it was perfection. At first the fact that it was topped with blueberry compote sounded odd, but it worked so so well. Our truffle fries were fresh and fantastic, and my friends blue cheese burger was great.  A little pricey for a burger from the outset, but keep in mind it goes with Vegas prices, and you're eating GR creations.  Would definitely recommended for any occasion!
1922	1	Like someone just slapped your tastebuds silly!  I'm a huge fan of Hell's Kitchen, so when I heard one of the newest restaurants he was going to open was going to be in Vegas, I flipped! Finally, I would get to experience one of his restaurants! I've been dying to eat one of his beef wellingtons after watching 10 seasons worth of contestants make it!  The hubby decided at the last second that we would drive to Vegas on Thanksgiving weekend, so getting a last second reservation was IMPOSSIBLE. Thank goodness for the bar area - first come, first serve! We came pretty early for dinner, so there were still a couple of tables open.  When you walk into the restaurant, it's nothing like the Paris casino. So hip, modern and cool!  It was so hard holding back from ordering practically everything on the menu, especially the appetizers! Lucky for us, the hubby and I went with our friend who used to work with the executive chef, Kevin Hee, at a previous job. So, he graciously sent our table extra appetizers!  All of the appetizers we had were great! The hamachi crudo was amazing! I loved the Iberico ham gelee and the caviar and truffle were an extra nice touch! The fried oysters had great texture! Just enough batter to oyster. Loved how they presented the oysters in the original shell! The kurobuta pork belly was so tender and flavorful!   The best appetizer of them all was the FOIE GRAS. *drool* I miss foie gras in California, so being able to eat this was a treat! So buttery and I loved the sweetness of the huckleberry with the salty foie.   The hubby and I shared the beef wellington as our main dish. It was cooked just right! The filet mignon was super tender. I loved the pastry dough on the outside. Don't forget to soak up the red wine demi glace with it! Just be careful though, the combination of the sauce and pastry dough make the steak slide around when you're trying to cut it.   We accompanied our steak with sauteed mushrooms and green been tempura. The mushrooms were good. The bonito flakes made it interesting. The green beans were nice because they were still really bright green and crispy even though they were fried. Great with the garlic aioli it came with!  We were sooooooo full after all of this. I almost skipped dessert. But I took one look at the menu and I just couldn't resist...  STICKY. TOFFEE. PUDDING.  This dessert is miiiiind blowing! From the second it touches your tongue, it's like BAM! Sweet pudding cake smothered with brown butter toffee. OH. EM. GEE. And don't forget the brown butter ice cream! SO GOOD! You will instantly make room in your stomach for this heavenly treat. You MUST get this dessert no matter how full you are!!  I had a great experience here! I would come back to just chow down on appetizers and that amaaaazing sticky toffee pudding!  By the way, sign up for a Total Rewards membership. You'll get a discounted price on all their items (about $1 - $2 off per item). Totally worth it! Can't wait to go back!
1463	1	We dined here last night for my boyfriends birthday. The food was amazing. The service was also amazing.   We ordered the chorizo stuffed lobster and the pork belly for appetizers. Both were equally delicious.   For main courses I ordered the beef Wellington and my boyfriend ordered the bone in rib eye. I'm a total fan of Hell's Kitchen which is why I ordered the Wellington. It certainly did not disappoint. The meat literally melted in your mouth.   While it was expensive, I felt it was worth every penny. I called ahead of time and ordered a dessert for his birthday. The sticky toffee pudding is spot on. ORDER IT! (If you have room)   Great place to celebrate a special occasion!! We will be back!
61	0	Went for breakfast and waited forever at the front for the rude hostess to even look at us.  Some bitchy granny seated is and lectured us about the dos and don'ts of eating breakfast.  Breakfast buffet was $16.00.  Because everything was not to my liking, I basically left there hungry.  The bacon was like chewing on plastic with artificial bacon flavoring.  The eggs were...(I have no words for them).  The only edible things were the fruits as they did not require cooking.  It was THE MOST DISGUSTING BREAKFAST I HAVE EVER HAD and so not worth $16. I had breakfast buffet at Mandalay Bay the previous day and it was awesome.   Do not eat here unless you have no other option. Between the disgusting food and the unfriendly staff, I can not understand why this dump exists in the basement of the hotels, which smells like a backed up sewer, by the way.
211	1	I ate here on the evening of December 26th with my family, and it was fantastic!! The great customer service started before we even got there! Our reservation (get a reservation by the way) was for 5:15pm, but we were still gridlocked in traffic on Sahara at that time. I called the restaurant to see if our reservation could be pushed back until 5:45pm. The hostess said she would hold our table until we arrived!  Shortly after we arrived we were seated at our table in the center of the restaurant. Our waiter was the best! He was very personable and explained the IPAD drink ordering menu to us. He then wheeled the meat cart over to us, so we could pick out our steaks (the meat cart is indescribable, you'll have to look at the photos) We ended up ordering the seafood platter for 4 as an appetizer, split the rib eye steak and lobster tail, and had the creamed spinach and Mac and Cheese on the side. Everything was delicious and the portions were generous. We didn't have room for dessert! We'll just have to get the sticky toffee pudding next time. We'll be back!!!

1756	0	We wanted to go the restaurant, but the wait was 30 minutes and all we wanted to do was to try the infamous Frozen Hot Chocolate.  So I appreciate that they had a "Fun on the run menu" which is basically a way to grab something quick. The service was definitely faster, our drink was ready right after we paid! Half star because the place was pink and cute. Half star because it tasted good. Minus four stars because the price was ridiculous and this place is seriously over-rated!   $10- Frozen Hot Chocolate: For taste, I thought this was chocolate goodness. However, my friend says it tasted like his protein powder mixture.  $11- Mochacino Coffee Frozen Hot Chocolate:  This was pretty tasty.  The mocha was rich in flavor and blended well with the chocolate.  I liked the espresso chocolate on top.  Although it was delicious, the Costco's version of Mocha Latte comes pretty close.   Would you pay $12 (after tax) for a regular size (16 oz. maybe) of iced hot chocolate topped with whipped cream?  Why do you call it Frozen hot chocolate when it wasn't even frozen or icy?
229	0	It sounds like a lot of people like the French Onion soup. Well, on the contrary, my cousin wasn't satisfied with his French Onion Soup at all. He took about 3 sips and gave up on it. I don't know if he's just picky, it was a bad day for french onion soup, or it's really just not that great.   I ordered the turkey pot pie. POT PIE? I love pot pies. I think it was the special of the day, so I gave it no second thought and ordered it. The first thing I thought to myself upon seeing my pot pie was, "UMMMMM, is this the right order? This looks like a croissant wannabe over a well of pea and turkey soup." Okay, I might be describing it worse than it actually is. Check out the picture I posted and judge for yourself. The presentation was nice, but wasn't at all how I imagined it. I dug into the puff pastry hoping to find lobster, but it was just more...puff pastry. =[ Boy was I bummmmmmmed. If only all the peas and turkey bits were INSIDE of the puff pastry..it didn't even taste that great, hence the 2 stars.   I won't come back unless I'm really hungry at night and everything else is closed-why? It's open 24/7.
1749	1	I rarely eat burgers so I figured if I'm going to splurge I'll head to Gordom Ramsey's BurGR! I ordered the blue burger and sweet potato fries! Way too much for me to finish, but so freaking delicious! I thought everything was awesome, including the service! Can't wait to go back to Vegas and try his other restaurants!
447	1	There are 1125 reviews for a reason In this industry (22 years and counting) and especially in this city, it is truly rare when you get amazing service, amazing food in a comfortable, warm, clean atmosphere If I could give 6 stars to our server, Angela, I would. She gave me the best service I have received in this city (2 years) and I have worked and managed some of the best restaurants, bars and clubs Ill be back again and again Thank you Peppermill
1519	0	Got to say this was the second Halloween we have spent here, this year and last year.  Very disappointed.  We had a group of ten plus people for two years and a row.  We ate dinner, it was mediocre at best.  Chicken tacos where dry and no flavor, basically just cooked chicken with cheese on top.  Enchiladas were ok, I could do a better job cooking at home, kind of sad for Vegas.  Last night oct 31, 2014, partied all night there after dinner.  Spent $60+ on dinner, plus $35 for all you can drink for myself and $55 for my wife's top shelf all you can drink.  Pretty reasonable drinking price for Vegas, but by 2 am tried to order tap water, in my all you can drink cup, and the bartender said $4 for a bottled water.  I said no tap water for free in my cup, he said no again trying to get me to buy a bottled water.  As we argued back and forth I finally gave up.  My wife went to the manager and complained how much money we spent for all you can drink and dinner, and that we should at least get our free water.  Crazy!  Then during the costume contest confetti was sprayed throughout the crowd, of course what do you do with confetti other than throw it.  Everyone was doing it, but the manager came over and grabbed my hand said not to throw the confetti.  He then grabbed my wife's hand too, I told him to let her go.  I can't believe he had the nerve to put his hand on her.  I was so pissed.  Unbelievable this guy is a manager.  This will be the last time our group goes to seor frogs.
540	1	Great service, delicious and fresh food (e.g. the squid in seafood pancake was supreme tender and fresh).would definitely return,but come earlier or.later to avoid the prime time. Only 11 regular tables so easy to end up with an hour wait. Totally yummy and worth it though!
578	0	Never again!!!    We purchase the deal through Travelzoo before we arrived. When we sat down, the waiter acted like he didn't know what the deal it was at first.  He kept looking then took a scanner out of his pocket and acknowledged it then explained the terms of it.  He definitely didn't seem to happy about it.  He asked if we had been before and I tried to explain that Chicago has one kind of like it.  He cut me off then said ok...salad bar is up there.   We were sitting near the bar and had to weave between other tables, waiters, and other guests to get there.   The plates were dirty and the salad bar was sloppy.  The floor is unbelievably slippery.  When we arrived back to our table, there was a very pretty and obviously pricey bottle of spring water on our table. I awkwardly asked the waiter that I just wanted tap water and he said fine and took it off our table.  The meats were ok...some were great, some not.  Two other tables filled next to us while we were there with similar deals and he acted the same.   The poor lady next to us had no clue how the process worked and was asking us because the waiter didn't explain it.   If you want a relaxing and pleasant experience, don't come here.
878	1	The Billionaire burger, though pricey, is definitely worth it. The foie gras compliments the burger so well. The flavor of all its components are exceptional. I wanted more! Loved the selection of spiked milkshakes (definitely recommend the tiramasu) and other alcoholic beverages to wash down the beef. We'll be back soon, no doubt.
744	1	One of the greatest dining experiences I've had all year, maybe all life. Burger was succulent, excellent roll, each bite was juicy and delicious. The Oreo Milkshake had some amazing aftertastes, and the entire experience from onion rings to fried pickles was a heavy one.  I went into a food coma afterwards for about 1/2 a day.  We ate at 4 p.m., and I was done for the rest of the day!  Highly, highly recommended.
340	0	No bueno. They charge a service fee but service is non existent!! They don't serve you so you have to go get your own drink, our server didn't pick up our plates for a long time and they were piling up so we put them on another table then she noticed and picked them up. We kept doing this during the whole meal.   We brought everything to the manager's attention and she told us they were understaffed and they were doing the best they could!   The food is not tasty and it's all very subpar. Disappointing but they're digging their own grave.
1132	1	My last meal on earth. I always try to stop here while in Vegas. Absolutely to die for.   My favorite -- Specifically the Roasted Chicken and Bacon & Chive Waffle. OUT OF THIS WORLD. The chicken is served a breast and a thigh with black truffle gravy. The waffle is served with Vanilla Bean butter and warm maple syrup. It doesn't look like much food but its just enough to fill you up and the presentation is beautiful.  Service is quick and attentive.
677	0	This place is in DESPERATE need of a major makeover. No extra blankets or pillows in the room. The bathroom 'looks' clean but with all the years of grime built up seems dirty. I won't take a bath in the tub because it needs a major scrubbing or to be replaced. Even the shower curtains are dated.  Only enough shampoo for one wash and NO bar soap.  Lamp shades have holes in them. TV is dated, even the programming is from the 80's and 90's.  Hallways are pretty quiet in the evening.  Room service is another area that's needs a major improvement. I ordered one pancake one egg and two milks for $23.80. It was brought to me in a bag in two 'to go' containers. No salt, pepper, or any other condiments, and food was ice cold by the time I got it which was less than 30 minutes from ordering. The room also lacks a table to eat a meal at while looking at the view of the roof.  The guy who brought it up was sketchy and almost wouldn't bring it in the room.  If I wasn't here on business and someone else paying for the room, I would move to another hotel.  All in all this place is a dump.
1469	0	One of the worst Vegas hotels I have been to. Needs to be badly remodeled. Very uncomfortable beds. Mediocre costumer service. The only positive thing I have to say about them is that they did not create a fight when I check out earlier and demanded a refund for the night that was not stayed. Although, it was through hotels.com. Will never return here!
1958	1	Yep! The expected stellar dining experience only Gordon Ramsay can guarantee!!  For Appetizer, we ordered the "Fuzzy Chicken Wings." Spicy & Tangy w/blue cheese crumbs! They were DAZZLING! Fell off the bone! Hmph!  For the Entree we ordered the "Uber Cheese Burger," -fontina, raclette & goat cheese- I added a fried egg! O. M. G! Superb cooking technique of the meat! It's the first thing you will notice! Very Woodsy! We also ordered the American. Boring, uninspired selection I thought...NOT SO! In fact, after BOTH of those selections I can confirm I will never enjoy any other Burger again after this experience, and if I NEVER eat a burger except here, I'm A okay with that! Oh! Can't forget the Truffle Fries! My God, if you are an Atheist, you won't be after the Truffle Fries! In fact, this has to qualify as baptism! The friggin Truffle Fries are a Divine Spiritual Experience!  Enjoy!!
723	1	Bachi Burger has an interesting menu for a burger joint. That's bc this joint serves no ordinary burgers! We began with the Bachi Pickles, an assortment of eight different types of pickles, all handmade and very delicious. We had the Sweet Potato Fries dusted with sea salt served up with Yuzu Citrus Aioli dipping sauce, a delicious match. Each of us ordered a burger - think of your juiciest most succulent backyard barbecue burger ever taking a quick trip to Japan and stopping off in Hawaii on the way back, and you have all the wonderful influences that make Bachi Burgers so wonderful. I ordered the Kiki Burger: 5 ounces (1/3 lb) of thick, juicy, tender, delicious Texas Kobe beef topped with caramelized bacon, Gruyere cheese, sweet onion marmalade, very tiny petite mushrooms and tender fresh cool greens, served on a warm bun. My dining partner enjoyed a Signature BBQ Bachi Burger, a tender 5 oz Angus Beef burger served up on a warm steamed bun with crispy cool lettuce, a thick slice of ripe tomato and thin slice of raw onion. Everything was better than we dreamed it would be! We look forward to our next visit.
971	1	Came with a group for dinner (Burger for dinner, really?). However, I got the $24 Huber Keller burger (Buffalo meat, Caramelized onion, baby spinach and blue cheese on a Ciabatta Bun. Served with red wine and shallot sauce) and a side of onion rings (substitute for skinny fries) and it was the best burger I ever had - hands down.  With a glass of red wine - heaven.
75	1	Oh have mercy on my soul THIS was amazing!!! We were seated right away, the service was incredible and the FOOD oh man, so good wish I had another stomach! We started with the Ox tail chili fries THAT alone sold me on the place. Then we had the Bahn-mi burger and the Ronin burger holy mother of god they were SOOO delicious. Our server came and checked on us without overly checking, which was great because we were too busy stuffing our faces! LOL we then finished off the meal with Portuguese doughnuts...the coffee ice cream was to die for. I can honestly say, THIS has been such a great food orgasmic experience that we will ALWAYS come here when we're in town! Thank you for the amazing food and service! An absolute must if your in town!
1787	1	One of the best Korean BBQ places in Vegas. It is honestly hard to beat this place. From the friendly staff, to the amazing food, this place is awesome. So Much Juice On That meat.   I went here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend and we truly enjoyed ourselves.  There was a minimal wait, but this allows you to take in the scenery.  You can watch TV as well as watch k pop and pop videos. It has a nice soft red tone to the restaurant. We honestly couldn't wait to sit and eat .
1163	0	I was honestly so dissapointed when I ate there. I honestly do not know what everyone was fussing about how it's the greatest thing in the world.  Cons: The line was long, (as suspected since it's new) once you get inside, there's another line. I don't know if they still have long lines since people know it's not the best lol The burgers were tiny and had very little taste to them, which I assume it's how it is in where it came from. It was very expensive for what you got to be honest. It was not good at all, way way over price. Like In-n-Out is better lol The kitchen where you can see them cooking the burgers is very unsanitary looking. There were buns everywhere, chopped onions on the floor, not to mention their was pretty brown lol DO NOT WORRY IF YOU HAVEN'T GONE THERE, YOU'RE NOT MISSING ANYTHING.  Pros:...umm they have really good chicken rings?  Hope this helps. I honestly would recommend to go there just to taste it just so you can say you've had it but I honestly doubt that anyone is going to return. Unless you're a tourist and drunk at 4 in the morning.
1547	1	GREAT place to go for drinks,romantic conversation (in the bar) or bring the whole family kids and all!   HUGE plates of food for NON strip prices! I love this place! Great drinks,great service and you may just get to see Miss Holly Madison!   I will ALWAYS be bringing visitors here when they come to Vegas, its a staple!
1940	0	i dont think i've ever hated a hotel as much as i hate the westin cauarina las vegas hotel they upgraded me to a full suite on my last stay, complete with three sinks, three rooms, and a walk-in closet they did everything a hotel could do to make it up to me but when you get robbed when you're staying in a hotel, you don't forgive easily
1681	1	I had a Birthday Cake Milkshake at Sugar Factory years ago and it was amazing.  Ever since they have not been great (supposedly they cannot get cupcake syrup or something anymore so they use vanilla), and I had felt deprived.    Once I found Holsteins, that was no longer an issue. Do yourself a favor next time in Las Vegas and go to this place and get the Birthday Cake Milkshake (has Vodka).  The price was similar to Sugar Factory (and this one has Vodka) and it was better.  We have had food there that was great too, most notably the fried pickles.    Ever since going to Holsteins the first time, I have gone back on every trip to vegas (for the shake).  I imagine I will continue this ritual forever.
899	1	Amazing. Food-gasm. Thomas effing Keller to the rescue. Words cannot describe my experience at Bouchon. I had the chicken, for god's sakes, and it was INCREDIBLE. The baguette? Like I had in Paris (yep, threw in the pretentious Paris card). Even the butter was amazing. Ended the meal with the lemon tart and could have died I was so happy. Do yourself a favor--go to Bouchon. Just go.
273	0	I was pretty stoked to check this place out, being a big Sammy Hagar fan, but I was pretty damn disappointed when it finally came to trying it out.  Dad and I went down for lunch, and we had a Groupon that was good for $30. We popped in around 12:30 PM, and it was already a difficulty just to find someone to seat us. There was no waitress around to seat us, so the hostess had us wait at the podium for a few minutes, and then she finally sat us herself. At this point, it was no biggie.  We sat down, and a waitress came up and took our drink order pretty quick...very friendly girl. She brought us some chips and salsa, which were pretty good.  I ordered the 4-item combo plate with a Carne Asada soft taco, a Chicken soft taco, a beef enchilada, and a chicken enchilada ($19) . Dad ordered Chicken nachos ($13). Let me just say, this is HIGHLY overpriced food.   The food was brought out, and we marvelled at how little was actually on our plates. Dad's nachos consisted of eight chips with chicken and cheese centered around a scoop of guacamole. To make matters worse, they were extremely bland.  My food was more of the same disappointment. I had asked for my soft tacos with just meat and cheese only, and they were PILED with stuff. When I finally wiped everything off, the meat didn't even taste great at all. It was all extremely bland. The rice was okay, but the enchiladas were HORRIFIC. I've never tasted worse green sauce in my entire life.  Throughout the meal, there was this annoying bus boy who hovered around our table. Whenever we would pause in eating, he would run up to our table and ask if he could take our plate. He did this three or four times, and every time he seemed to get cockier. Let us eat our mediocre food in peace!!  After all was said and done, I'm glad we had a Groupon...though I wished I hadn't even spent the time eating there. Avoid!
455	0	I've heard good things about this place, besides for the long lines of course, so I thought I would give it a try. My BF was there earlier and waited in line so I was lucky I didn't have to wait that long. We came on a Friday night around 6 and the place was super packed already. It took us about 15 minutes before we were actually seated. Dinner was $11.30 Monday-Friday and $12 over the weekend. Drinks are an additional $2.  As for the food...they have a... Salad bar:  Salad bar was okay. Nothing special about it. You can create your own salad with any topping you could think of or they have a pre-made ceaser salad. They also had 2 different types of soup that day, chicken noodle and chili. They also had your typical potato salad/mac salad/ and stuff like that so nothing really stood out about their salad bar.  Mexican/American/Italian/Asian food: they had a variety of different types of food, but none of them were too my liking. I'm not a picky eater. I'll try everything once, but the food was just...boring to me. They had your typical orange chicken, kung pao something, quesadilla, onion rings, pasta, fried chicken, pizza, fried shrimp, and more.  Grill area: around the grill area they had toast, fried/popcorn shrimp, stuffing and of course the steak. My BF got a steak on his first plate and it was cooked just how he wanted (medium rare) and it wasn't dry at all. He liked it so he got another one and that one came out super dry that he couldn't finish it. But the steak in my opinion wasn't that good. It didn't have any flavor on it at all.  Desserts: they had pies, cakes, the chocolate fountain, cotton candy, and ice cream. None of those things really stood out to me either. I had to get a marshmallow covered in chocolate though, but the strawberries were so tiny and didn't look appetizing at all. Ice cream of course is always good and I've never seen a buffet with rainbow sherbet so that made me happy. And take the cotton candy before you leave!  Service: It was good actually. Better than most buffets I've gone to. Plates were taken away pretty quickly and drinks were refilled when we barely drank half of the cup. Seeing how crowded the place was, I was pretty surprise with the service.
1259	0	I'm not too satisfied with Serendipity. I ordered their coffee (very expensive, but reasonable for Vegas) and their strawberry cheesecake dessert (insanely expensive and super fatty/not worth it). The reason I give it 2 stars is b/c of their poor service. It's a horrible place. It took us 10 minutes to get seated for 2 people, 10 minutes to even order, and they GAVE US THE CHECK 5 minutes into the dessert. What the heck is that service? It's common courtesy to give the check when requested, unless it's a fast food place I can understand. Overall, I'm not going back. Nor should you.
1969	1	Don't let the look from outside fool you. It looks much better inside. Apart from the tiny entrance, this place is actually huge and clean. Food quality is  great, however it come in small quantities compare to other Thai restaurants. Thai Ice Tea and Ice Coffee also great, too.
530	0	Let me start by saying this is my first negative review on yelp, and its because i dont want you to waste your money like us. I dont even know how this place has 3 stars. Nothing was even good about it. Our server waS good i feel bad he has to work for such a low quality restaurant. Save yo money people for a awesome brazilian steakhouse like texas de brasil
961	1	Hands down, the best burger I've ever eaten.  I had the HK burger and my wife had the Brittania, and both of them were flat-out phenomenal.  "It's cooked beautifully" (in my best GR voice.  The servers are very attentive, the pricing isn't bad ($15 for this burger wasn't out of line, IMHO), and everything about the restaurant smacks of attention to detail.    Try the sweet potato fries.  Absolutely delicious.    This place is worth the wait.  You could also wait until after midnight, usually there's no line by then.
701	0	This might be my first one star review. Awful, especially for the price.  Where do I begin? Slimy bagged lettuce, ridiculously runny poached eggs, mushy fruit, and KRAFT ranch dressing (all their dressings). All meat entrees were bad and dry. Nothing tasted good, seriously. For 24$ a person for lunch?! Ridiculous. Told server food was bad, he didn't seem to care. Not much he can do I guess. Go spend your hard earned money elsewhere for good quality food. I hear Cesar's Palace Buffet is good. Bellagio and Monte Carlo are decent. Shoot, even Golden Corral is better. Stay far away from Bayside Buffet.
14	0	When there on Sunday nite with my wife to have late dinner. I have been here before food is ok service was good but this time service was terrible , we sat there for 20 min no one showed up I got up and asked one of the girls in front for help and that didn't help, finally a waiter showed up to say hello and left as fast as he showed up. I say if they were busy Ok but they weren't. That's the last time I'm going to go there and would not recommended anybody to go there.
1505	1	We came for lunch and we are very impressed! The prime kalbi was amazing. Two of us has bibimbap and the size was bigger than we expected, and very delicious. It had plenty of crispy rice. One had the spicy tofu soup, and it had just the right amount of spice and the tofu was perfectly cooked. I liked that we could order meals and things to bbq. There were many options and we will definitely be eating here again. The staff was polite and attentive and very helpful.
954	1	SO GOOD!! Tried it for the first time. Got white pizza for $5 and it was simply CHEESEY GOODNESS! They reheat the pizza for you so when you it's nice and crispy when you eat! Though this place isn't very secret anymore since the line gets pretty long, it's worth the wait! Perfect place to go after clubbing at Marquee since it's open til 5 am. There's not that much room for you to sit and eat inside, but there's a seating area right outside with a pool table. Definitely a good place to stop by in Cosmo!
1472	1	Excellence.  I love coming to hash house, and I am from San Diego, so I usually visit the San Diego hash house a go go. But the Vegas one did not disappoint! The food is amazing, the portions are crazy, the prices are decent , the service and staff are friendly and on there A game, and did I mention the food is amazing?  Breakfast and Lunch/dinner is all delicious. I actually came to this one after a massive hangover for my 21st birthday. Made me feel 1000 times better! FYI the bell pepper burger is BEYOND THIS WORLD GOOD!   The only con is the wait can be long, but honestly, it's worth the wait. :)
366	1	This place is a truly unique experience!  First of all you have to try the Pineapple Tea. If you go and do not try this beverage you're soul will forever be missing a piece.  Next, the burgers are a pleasant mix of barbecue flavor and tender juicy beef patty. Not only are they super delicious but they are also very decent sized. They do come a la carte so I ordered a side of edamame and can I just tell you how satisfying it was to order and enjoy a great plate of edamame at a burger joint?  So much yes.
133	1	Hidden little gem in Cosmopolitan hotel! This place has no signs, and they do not advertise it. It's one of those... if you know about it type of thing. Funny thing is, I learned about Secret Pizza in an airplane, and knew I just had to try it for myself.  It's tucked away in a little hallway, full of people who just got done clubbing. I guess some can easily say it's drunk people food. Absolutely not!! I believe they do not advertise it because it is "Secret Pizza" after all.. I think this place would appeal more to the young adults. There are no actual tables, and just a little bar counter with a few stools and chairs... maybe five? There wasn't really a place to eat, and it would have been pretty awkward to eat there while the line of people stare at you because of the way it was arranged. I recommend getting take-out! Long line, but they do try to get you out of there as quickly as possible. The crust is extremely thin I assume so it can cook much quicker, some of the veggies are pre-cooked in advance, and the mushroom is sliced paper thin to reduce cooking time.  I've eaten pizza from here at least 10 times, and I think it's safe to say it's my absolute favorite pizza joint!   The pizza is delicious! I think it's one of the best one's I've ever had. I still crave it...... WHYYYY do you have to be sooo far away!?!? Well I think only in vegas will I be willing to cough up $40ish for my pizza. Worth every penny though!! The slices are very big, and they are pretty generous with their toppings. I ate at almost every eatery/ restaurant in Cosmo, and I must say, this place was my favorite! I had to eat here twice, and still craved for more!! The menu is literately typed and printed on normal computer paper. The cover of the menu simply says "Pizza"  I ordered a Five Toppings "Pie"  $29.00 -18 inches, 10 slices. Each Additional topping was $2.25 Toppings Pepperoni Sliced Sausage - Yum! Meatballs Roasted Tomatoes Fresh Garlic- Added a very nice touch Green Peppers Mushrooms-sliced so paper thin to reduce cook time..almost couldn't taste it! ): Onions Ricotta  Overall, I can't wait to go back!! I would highly recommend this place, enjoy!!!
952	1	High quality meat, extremely rich in flavor, great service, & a cute ambience. What more can you ask for? Our server suggested we try the gangnam style BBQ for our first time. From the starters to the dishes, you will not be disappointed! At the end of our meal, we still managed to squeeze in dessert, which was just as good. From the mochi ice cream to the lava cake to honey toast, everything here was on point. Definitely set the standards for Korean BBQ for me.
1684	0	I've lost my wonder for Serendipity. The first time I came here I was so excited and maybe that made the experience better, but to be honest this last time, it was MEH. I don't think Ill return again- it's one of those places where your like "okay been there done that, no need to try again". The portion are large but not that flavorful, kind of boring and expensive. Our table ordered breakfast and two frozen hot chocolates. The cookies and cream frozen hot chocolate is still the best, I strayed and ordered the Amaretto one, which was okay, but I felt like there was only a tiny bit of almond flavoring- so after the first few sips the flavor was gone. For breakfast we ordered the breakfast quesadilla and the breakfast sandwich- for the price I would rather of made these at home.   So I guess my point is go once, just to say you tried it, skip on the food and just get the frozen hot chocolate.
1122	1	The best brunch on the strip!!!  Since they don't take reservations for brunch but recommend coming in earlier to avoid longer wait, I along with my friends got there around 9:30 and were seated within a few mins.  From the first moment you step on you can feel the cheerful/bright ambiance. Service, decor, and creativity all are bound to win your heart.  The food is definitely authentic french and hence even the French toast aren't the traditional ones you get at the American brunch restaurants. Not to say it was anything short of delicious.  Overall I had a great time and can't wait to get back for round 2 the next time I'm in that city.
243	0	I heard a lot of hype about Pink's so I was expecting some awesome hot dogs.  I was hugely disappointed.  My sister and I shared the mushroom swiss dog, the bacon chili cheese dog and a side of onion rings.  I was surprised that our order came out looking like regular hot dogs and buns (that you'd buy from any grocery store) slathered in everyday condiments.  I totally agree with the other reviews that there was really nothing special about the food here.  The mushroom swiss dog was disgustingly coated in mayo.  I like mayo but not to the point where that's all you taste with every bite.  The bacon chili cheese tasted no better than something I could have ordered at Wienerschnitzel...super salty and the chili tasted nasty like it was "fresh" out of the can.  Of all the things we ordered, the best thing was probably the onion rings but there wasn't anything extraordinary about those either.  Honestly, this place is no different than any other fast food joint except that it's highly overrated.  We actually came here after several rounds of mojitos and even then it still didn't taste any good.
1136	0	Overpriced and underwhelming. I'm so disappointed  I wasted a meal eating here.  A salad, shake, soda and burger with a side of onion rings for $50???? The salad was over dressed and extremely salty. The burger tasted like it was a frozen grocery store patty.  Not worth the trip at all.
251	1	I like hide and seek and here is a place I think I could hide forever without being found AND they have pizza! Perfect!   My girlfriends had never been in here before so I took them to the secret location and they were already in a trance by all the vintage album covers lining the wall. Once inside we discover we are the only girls so that always helps.   The guys working behind the counter were down to earth and super sweet. I ordered the slice of white pizza and they put a cold tomato on it once it comes out of the oven. The pizza guy was real cool so I think the slice was around $3 and I tipped him $7. As I am approaching cougar age I find I tip younger guys more.....First sign of a cougar, maybe? Shhh. Let's not talk about it.   Back to the pie. Hot damn that was good. I could have pounded down four more slices easily. The garlic, the cheese and the contrast of the cold tomato worked wonders in my mouth. I also tried a bite of the cheese slice with red sauce. Also dynamite.   I'm hooked on this place. I have spent big bucks on a couple of  Cosmo's fine dining restaurants and I have to say the best meal I have had came from the secret pizza place.... I will be back. Oh yes, I will be back.

Downside: Our toilet was spewing like a geyser and we saw a humungo roach crawl across the floor. Called maintenance/front and they acted like we should've expected it....that was after the 3rd call to them. WOW!  Tip: Try the raspberry mojito at the pool bar. The 2 for 1 drink specials are gonna get you snockerbockered!
1652	1	This place is amazing  ! We had to wait about 45 min (weekend) but it was definitely worth it , wife and I had the marinated kalbi and prime kalbi definitely get the marinated version . We also had bacon asparagus and fondue cheese broccoli as well as 2 other meats we forgot the name of but it was thin sliced ... Amazing. Our food took awhile but they served us extra side dishes !!! Amazing !!!!
487	1	"Big things poppin' and little things stoppin" - TI  This place is wonderful.  Thank you anthony bourdain and jet tila for introducing this place to the world.  It is off the strip so a bit harder to get to but the food is poppin with flavor.     *****papaya salad - AAammazing spicy but amazing best i ever had **** garlic prawns - poppin with flavor ** soft shell drunken noodle - it was ok  Stick with the dishes at the back of the menu
225	0	This place is very very over hyped in my opinion. Came here because most of the buffets in Vegas had already cut off their lines and my friends have been wanting to give it a try. The dining wait was about 45 minutes and by this time, we were all already too hangry to wait so we ordered in the outside togo/patio area instead.   I got myself a bacon cheeseburger and fries. My burger was very bland and had no flavor at all. The meat wasn't even juicy, just dry. :( The fries were mediocre at best. I did try some of my friend's frozen hot chocolate (which is what they're famous for), and it was probably the best thing I had.   Probably best to only grab the frozen hot chocolates here!
468	1	I'm not a name dropper in reviews, however, I have to give credit where credit is due. When you're visiting Las Vegas, Ryan L. is the man who knows where to go. And he definitely wasn't wrong about breakfast at Bouchon.   Nestled in a more remote section of the Venetian, overlooking their smaller pool, it's a little taste of subdued French Bistro dining right in the heart of Las Vegas. Serene and absolutely lovely. We dined outside on the patio and basically had the place to ourselves... which is not surprising at 8 am on a Thursday in Las Vegas. Hell, when we were walking to breakfast, there were oodles of girls in sequined mini dresses still shooting craps in the Venetian casino, but I digress.   My simple scrambled eggs, bacon, brioche toast and croquettes with an iced coffee on the side (it IS 107 degrees in Vegas in July, you know) was done perfectly. The croquettes, my favorite part of the meal, were so incredibly smooth and creamy on the inside, I wanted to swoon. Right at my table. In front of a colleague. Yes, that good.   Pricey? Sure. It's Vegas, baby! Everything is decedent, outlandish and off the charts unreasonably priced. But you gotta eat, right? So why not do it in style at Bouchon?
440	1	Went to Gordans steakhouse with the family and friends. Food was really good but quite expensive. Service was great and the restaurant was beautiful. Most Everything is a la carte. It was really cool When they brought out a meat cart and present the different cuts of steak they offer.   We had a big party and had to split a check for our family and they really messed it up. He said it was ok to tip in cash and charge the rest of the bill onto the credit card. We were charged for tip on our credit card after we gave the waiter cash for the tip. We called the restaurant and had to get it fixed. It all could've been avoided if he had remembered to take the gratuity out of the total. I guess we all are human and make mistakes. All in all I Wouldn't mind coming here again.
1364	1	The best KBBQ in Vegas. Literally my first stop every time I visit Las Vegas.   The portion size is quite large for kbbq. You really get the most for your money here. The grill isn't sticky like other places I've been and it isn't smokey.   My favorite dish is the Korean galbi. It's not too salty and has a nice marbling of fat without being fatty. The combination of sweet meats with enoki mushrooms coupled with a sweet onion and perfectly steamed rice keeps me coming back time and time again.   When you've had enough of the overpriced food from the overhyped restaurants on the strip, hop over to gangnam for a great meal the whole family will enjoy at a price that will keep you at the poker table a little longer.
461	0	I'll give this place 2 stars only because the selection of food was great and what I ate was pretty good. However, the way my friends and I were treated by the staff was horrible. I attended a wedding at the Mandalay Bay and the bride and groom chose to have the guest eat here. The guest and weeding party (about 20 people total) went ahead of the bride and groom to go eat. We were told by the cashier at the front that we would have to pay 18% gratuity even though we were all paying seperatly and not sitting together. All we asked of the staff was to sit in the same general area. The staff told us we would have to pay the tax anyway, why I'm not sure; It's not like we asked them to put tables together or anything. Also, there was hardly anyone in the restaurant at the time.   Because this is where the bride and groom wanted to eat and we didn't want to spoil their special day, we decided to pay separately and what does the staff do.... Intentionally seat everyone all over the restaurant. They didn't even try to seat anyone together.   Finally fed up with what they were doing, we took it upon ourselves to find seats next to each other because the staff was being very unreasonable. As I'm walking, I'm being followed and hounded by a waitress and a supervisor asking me and other people "are you going to pay the 18% tax to sit there"? I thought that was very classless and a very poor example of customer service.   The staffer said if we all sit in the same area, we would be overwhelming the waiter; keep in mind this is a buffet where we get our own food, not a waiter. And more so. After we moved and were seated and eating, the wait staff was seating more people in the same area we moved to. If there were originally worried about overwhelming the waiter, why would they seat more people in that section? Especially when the restaurant still was not even half full?  The food is good, the macaroni bar is really good and the seafood was fresh.
727	1	Made a reservation because of Yelp reviews.  Drove into the crazy/odd parking lot and didn't drive out because of Yelp reviews.  Went inside - sat down - ordered salad rolls......it just felt right. There were many regular customers who were warmly welcomed, families and out of "towners" it just felt good in there! You could tell there were plenty of foodies - long conversations with waiters - people asking for "the best" and "you order for me, this is what I like...."  We ordered: Prawns on Drunken Noodles - I am rarely at a loss for words - all I could say when asked was - "I am so happy".   Beef dish with peanut sauce - also wonderful - though the previously mentioned was by far my favorite.   The service was as expected - prompt, tidy, nice but not overly solicitous. If you are looking for amazing waiters and ambiance go somewhere else. If you are looking for perfect - and I mean perfect food - please join in the feast - like many have said before - the place is so worth it.
319	1	Great atmosphere, customer service, very good food for the money. Delicious burgers, not the greasy type from the fast food restaurants that give you a heartburn, but a very delicate, tasty, creative ones that leave you feeling full, yet not overloaded. Great beer selection as well.
196	1	DEFINITELY WORTH THE DRIVE We found our way here by accident last year and made a point of going back this year. Everything is delicious that we have ordered. Pork carnitas skillet was perfection. Apple cinnamon pancakes were delicious as was the often-mentioned banana nut muffin. Come hungry or share...they are generous with their portions.
1209	1	Awesome place. Located in Mandalay Bay Hotel. Good beer list and extensive menu, with obviously their specialty is burgers. I built my own with a fried egg and I followed it up with a chocolate shake. The service was great. My favorite place for burgers and can't wait to go back.
953	1	One platter can fill the needs of two hungry people. Three not so hungry people. A group of 5 for a snack.   Get liquor in your coffee starting at 7:30 am. I would suggest the Mexican coffee.   Loved the house smoked salmon w/ basil pesto, fresh tomato and melted brie cheese. Must get the french toast.
1545	1	We came here Friday night, i was expecting they would be really busy, but when we got there, it was just enough people, not too busy but not slow.. We got sat right away, we got the gangnam set and it was so much food, it says its for party of 2, but i think it's a lot of food just for two people unless you're a big eater.. Lol..service was really good too, and overall experience it was good..:-) we'll be back for sure..
1345	1	It can't be a trip to Vegas without grabbing a slice of pizza from the secret pizza place in the Cosmo hotel. Every slice is delicious down to the last bite. There's mainly standing room to eat your pizza but right outside there's plenty of seating in the hotel. You can see them making the pizza right as you walk in! It's a good place for a quick bite, they usually have a couple of different pizzas made where you can order by the slice, but don't fret, they also make whole pizzas for takeout.
1635	0	This place is poorly run.  The people at register have two lines, one for platinum and one for regular customers. Both were empty so we thought it'd be fine to just ealk in through the platinum entrance because we didn't want to walk around the corner and have to follow some velvet rails, but apparently it isn't ok and we were told to go out and line up again anyways, a waste of everyone's time. Then they have a line for a waitress. What kind of buffet has seating waitresses? I've never had to be shown to a designated seat at any type of AYCA and this place isn't even busy. There's seating EVERYWHERE. Lastly for ll that, utensils are managed by the waiters. I couldn't get a new fork for this second dish that had vastly different food. I dont want my meat forks in my salads because it's greasy.  Foodwise, it's definitely not as good as it looks. Rhe selection is also really small for the price we payed, but it's Vegas so I expected as much. At least it looks nice here.
1858	1	I don't know why I never reviewed this place sooner, but this is the home of some of the best burgers I have ever had, period.  I went there with the bf for lunch, so it wasn't too busy and we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a booth. I liked the fact that each booth had it's own TV. Cute.  The service was fine as well...I don't recall waiting forever or having an issue at all. Maybe it's just the luck of the draw? In any case, screw the service, focus on the burgers!  I love Hubert Keller, so I was definitely expecting something amazing. I ordered the 3 sliders, which were simply DIVINE.  I still have flashbacks to eating the one with cheese and caramelized onions! If I could only have one last burger before I died, that would be the one.  There were some more expensive burgers on the menu that I had been tempted to try, but since I hadn't ever been there before, I chose to be a bit frugal until I figured out if I approved of the burgers.  Boy, do I approve!  When I head back there though, I think I'll have to try something with truffles (my fav.!)...
921	1	I finally made it back to Bouchon and this time for brunch. It was the best breakfast I had on this trip...er, although I as subject to convention food breakfast, so relatively speaking it honestly doesn't take much to be a best breakfast.  That's not to say the food was bad. No, it was very very good.  Our waiter, whose name I do not recall sadly, led us through some recommendations that we were very happy with.  * Sweetbreads to start. Mmm, glands. It was on the specials chalkboard. * Pan roasted trout, piled with vegetables. With clear eyes on the fish head. Fresh! * Chicken and waffles. Yummy. Is it really French? Do I care?  And lots of coffee.   Definitely the priciest of breakfasts, and worth it.  We admired the selection of absinthe at the bar, and also the good beers on tap.   I couldn't really feel any "food magic" in the space. It felt like the typical good food decadence I feel in the strip area of Vegas.  But if I can walk into a restaurant, see the food I'm eating, and dine without hearing the endless bings and bonks of casino machines, I'm pretty happy. Service and food can't be faulted for anything, for my experience. But I was bummed that the people at two small tables nearby me seemed unhappy. One duo effectively dined alone, as their food arrived 15 minutes apart and there was never a time they had food together on the table. Another, um, gererously portioned couple seemed unhappy with the size of their meals.  Since casinos are probably not very far away from handing out collectible feed sacks to strap to our faces in the buffets, I leave it to the latter couple to sort out what best meets their dining expectations.  For the former, the management came and resolved the issue as best they could and I admire the duo for leaving the waiter a very generous tip, as the timing of the food preparation was not his fault.  I've done a dinner here, as well as a brunch. It was very good, but I probably don't need to return for a meal. Bouchon has kind of blown its wad and I don't get the impression that an encore is necessary. Maybe for some absinthe, or a pastry from the bakery.
1608	1	Pardon my French when I say that Bouchon is f*#$%^& superb!   My friend and I made plans in advance to have brunch here. Unfortunately, we later discovered that brunch is only served on weekends. Instead, we chose to have a late breakfast. Bouchon only takes reservations for dinner, so it's first come, first served for breakfast and lunch. We arrived at around 11:00am on a Tuesday. The restaurant wasn't busy, but we did have to wait for about 10 minutes in their sectioned off wait area.   APPETIZER Terrine de Foie Gras de Canard (2.5 oz) with toasted baguettes: I hate liver. Naturally, I had some qualms about trying foie gras, but I was still game for it and kept an open mind. The foie gras' flavor really surprised me: It's smooth, buttery, and it didn't taste anything like liver with its irony "twang." I really can't describe its flavor other than it gets better with each taste. Spread it  on a slice of toasted baguette and gently rub some of the accompanying salt -- your taste buds will thank you. The amount we ordered was more than enough for the two of us.  BREAKFAST Croque Madame: Although located on the lunch menu, it makes for a great breakfast entree. Basically, this is the ultimate ham and cheese sandwich topped with a fried egg. What really makes this sandwich awesome is the mornay sauce, which is a white, creamy cheese sauce that's poured on top. To really push your carb intake to the edge, a large serving of french fries comes with this order.   For caffeine junkies, order the coffee. I like how it's neither too weak nor too strong. What I also like is how you can have your coffee to go.  OVERALL Future brunch and dinner plans were discussed between my friend and myself during our breakfast. I think that's suffice to say that we'll be returning. Bouchon is as close to Europe as you'll get in Vegas. There's no rush to finish your meal. The server isn't going to place your bill on the table minutes after your food arrives. Dining here really allows you to savor your meal and to enjoy the company your with.
1831	1	Great customer service, very friendly and welcoming!! Definitely one of the best Korean Bbq places I have been at in Las Vegas. I love the spicy tuna sushi and Korean prime Kalbi I get that all the time along with the beef torro. Coming here again!!!!
1198	0	Long wait. Over priced for the quality.  Only think good about the Saturday brunch was the guacamole and sour cream with the omelet. That was actually good. But not worth 27 bucks...  haven't been to a brunch buffet in awhile now I know why.... lmao won't be coming back...
1701	0	This restaurant confuses me. Perfect example of bad fusion. It's not even really fusion since it's just 2 concepts in the same restaurant (you can get a taco and noodles).   I had the open sesame which was ok. Not bad, not good but definitely not worth the $14. Friend has the pork sandwich ($10) that was TINY. And he got his meal 5 minutes before us and has already finished it before we got our noodles. Bad timing.   The customer service was good, everyone was nice but overall was a weird experience. Just not worth the money.
491	1	Seriously, some of the best pizza I've ever had... and I had to go all the way to Las Vegas to get it! Sure, I'm here in NYC where supposedly there's lots of good pizza, but so far, nothing comes close to what I had at the Pizzeria at The Cosmopolitan Hotel & Resort. This place is hidden in between a few other restaurants in a shopping & dining area attached to the hotel-- there are no signs, so if you can't locate it, ask around. You won't be sorry.   So what made this pizza so awesome? Well, first off, the crust was just right-- not too crunchy and not too soft... the pizza sauce was perfect and seasoned just right... and the cheese and toppings were fresh and tasty. On two different visits last week, I had a couple of difference slices-- I tried both the pepperoni and meatball. The 2nd time I had them add ricotta to my meatball slice... and all I can say is, "Amazing!"
356	1	With the various appetizers and meat, it was an amazing experience for me, especially on my first time. We ordered fried calamari, cream cheese wontons, mixed tempura, etc. for our appetizers. The pork belly and bulgogi are to die for. The servers were super friendly and were there when we needed their service. There a specific server that I took a liking who constantly checked on us and he made my stay more pleasing! Hope to stop by when I'm in the area again!
516	1	Hands down the best steak place I've ever been to, although I may be biased being a fan of Gordon Ramsay. I'm not a huge meat lover to begin with and I've always felt meh about steaks especially (almost disliking them even), but I had high expectations for this place. I knew weeks ahead of time that I had wanted the beef wellington - the meat cart that they lug out to show their diners the different cuts? Wasn't even phased by it, though I found it awesome and very helpful since my boyfriend was unsure about the sizing of the different cuts. I was SUPER hyped to finally try the beef wellington after watching seasons upon seasons of Hell's Kitchen and seeing how difficult it was for those chefs to make one cute little beef wellington. Let me tell you, it definitely did not disappoint. I can't even describe the sensation I had as I put a cut of the meaty goodness into my mouth. It was as if all of my steak endeavors had finally reached an epiphany - that all other steaks I'd tried before had been subpar because I had been waiting for this moment of eating Ramsay's signature beef wellington. A true masterpiece. All I could do was moan about how delicious it was because I was speechless. I would recommend those who come here to definitely give it a try.  The other, less important, dishes we ordered were half a dozen oysters, the wagyu sliders, and my boyfriend got the American rib cap as his entree.   The oysters were alright. I'm a huge fan of oysters so I wanted to get them for myself but they're nothing spectacular or amazing. Definitely skippable unless, of course, you're dying to get your aphrodisiac on before hitting the club. I'm always trying to get my aphrodisiac on.  The American wagyu sliders come in 2 little burgers, perfect to split on a dinner date. They are delicious! Seasoned and cooked to perfection. I would recommend trying them! So cute and adorable.  My boyfriend really enjoyed his rib cap though I don't think it even compared to the beef wellington tbh if I say so myself, but again, I'm probably biased.  The complementary bread is also really good! We didn't get to try the walnut (?) one because my boyfriend is allergic to nuts, so we skipped that one, and the lemon one wasn't that great, but the two that are shaped like little muffins were amaze. I could eat those breads for days.  One thing that had me a little sad was that they don't do anything special for birthdays besides very briefly say, "Happy birthday!". Bummer.  Very expensive meal, dropped almost 3 bills, but very worth it. Will definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas and try the mac n cheese.
1997	1	Best Restaurant in Vegas.... Maybe the whole world actually! (Bold statement but I feel it's warranted!)  We arrived around 8:20pm and there wasn't a table available for over an hour. As it was just the two of us, we decided to sit by the bar which is full service with no wait time. I would like to add that we tried to book a table earlier in the day but after being given the number to the casino, then the hotel, we gave up and decided to head on over once we were hungry. Anyway suffice to say if you would prefer a table I would definitely recommend booking, it was jam packed all night. (No wonder!!)  So to start.... The bar tender Oscar is bloody brilliant!!! Friendly, professional and very knowledgable. My husband had a beer and I got a custom made strawberry daiquiri with 1/3 alcohol because I really am a lightweight.   This was hands down the most delicious, we'll made, perfectly balanced cocktail I have ever had in my life. I'm only 32 years old but my gosh, I have been waiting for a drink to love my whole life and now I have found it! The strawberry and lemon mixed beautifully with the gin and then the hint of basil brings it all together!! Seriously. Worth every penny and I kinda wish we could have an oscar clone in our house to teach us how to make perfect drinks!  As we are perusing the menu some delightful breads came out... Still warm.. With a lovely butter. I'm British and my husband is American and our taste buds often differ but we were both delighted! The breads were absolutely divine and a lovely selection.   We shared the pork belly to start - 10/10! I can really appreciate a well cooked pork belly and this was melt in the mouth delicious!  The onion and jam that was served with the pork was perfect. If you had seen us you would have seen the pure joy with every bite. This sounds like an exaggeration doesn't it? It's not. If anything there aren't the words to describe how wonderful it was!   For the main meal I had the lamb duet and my husband had the beef Wellington, guess how they tasted? That's right yelp land. Bloody perfect! America doesn't offer enough lamb dishes if you ask me... Delighted to see that Gordon is offering a traditional British dish (shepherds pie & lamb chops) and taken them to the next level!  I'm confident the beef Wellington  was a delicious as my husband reports -- although my lamb was so good I didn't take a bite of his at all!    We ended out perfect meal with a cheese plate and a delightful sticky toffee pudding. Good on Gordon for adding such a staple British pudding to his menu and elevating it to such a high standard! We were audibly satisfied after the first bite - the ooh and ahh that we made during our meals showed the staff how amazed we were.   My husband rounded off the meal with  johnnie walker blue label neat - and it was the perfect end to the perfect meal.   What else? We have covered the food (to clarify: amazing, 10/10, delicious, perfectly cooked and seasoned and presented) .... Let's go with the extras.   Ambience: yes. It's dark and it's loud. Noticed that some other yelpers moaned about the music being too loud.... It is loud but I much prefer hearing some inoffensive music to the sound of other diners chatting!   Staff: I would totally recommend sitting at the bar. I already mentioned how lovely and awesome Oscar is. There was also Tracy and Paul. Both as magnificent and polite and professional. What a quality team! They look clean and tidy and we'll presented (off topic but.... Tracy is beautiful with some wonderful eyebrows!!) they were attentive and not overbearing which is a very fine line being at the bar. I appreciated that they kept our water topped up.   Restrooms: so clean and tidy. I also liked that I was shown to them when asked, rather than being pointed through the crowds.   merchandise: there is a selection of items for sale, displayed very well in the wine rack. I have NEVER in my life bought a tshirt from a restaurant but I will be gladly adorning my Gordon tee, and if they had the red one in men's sizes, my husband would have too.   Overall: I am pretty picky. I am hard to please. I turned to my husband half way through the meal and said - when have I ever loved every single thing about a meal? His reply? Never in your life. THATS right! never before have I been so impressed with a restaurant. We spent $350 and I would happily spend it again tomorrow if we weren't leaving! My husband is going to be away for a year and leaves at the beginning of June. This is our goodbye date in vegas and and this night absolutely made the trip. I am coming back to vegas in  a few weeks to meet with family from the UK and if they don't want to come, I will happily dine at the bar alone. It's that good!   Excellent service Excellent food Value for money Amazing amazing amazing!   My husband and I are pretty big Gordon fans given that he is bloody brilliant! but now? He's pretty much our favorite ever!
58	0	Came in with a party of 12 under a reservation. It took 50 minutes to place our order for food, after an hour seated we finally got our drink order. If you want a burger, one could literally butcher a cow, grind the beef, and cook it yourself faster than the "service" at this restaurant. One could probably drill a well for water faster than they brought it to the table, as well.
1329	1	Solid burger joint. My family felt it was on the same level as In n Out. The service was great. The burger was very good. The fries and shakes were also good. No complaints. Definitely recommend it if you're in the area and have never tried this place.
168	1	WOOOO, Shake Shack. I still have dreams about you.  I'm so glad we decided to cancel our original lunch plans to stop in here. Best decision we made all day.  The was a bit of a lineup, but it moved quite quickly. After ordering, we're given a buzzer which was cool. A little more organized than calling out numbers. The location was kept very clean and modern inside. It wasn't too hard to find seats, as there is a lot of turn over here and guests are considerate to leave once done their meal.  We wanted to try the original, so we ordered the double, draft root beer and a strawberry shake. All GREAT! The burger was just so melt in your mouth delicious. It was a tad salty, but that didn't stop me from devouring this beast.  The shake was sooo friggen good. I would go back just for a shake, but it would be hard to resist a burger. The root beer was only alright, I'm not sure I would order it again.  Overall, I was amazed. Burgers are one of my favourite foods, I'm not easily amazed by a burger, but when I am, it's so eye opening.   This is a definite must when going to Vegas (or NY)
1577	1	I freaking LOVE this place!  All the times I would go to Vegas and drive by, I would think--I  want to go there because it looked so funny.    Anyways, last February is the first time I went to the Peppermill with my then fiance--but now turned hubby.  :)  He said this place is linked to a chain in NorCal and Tahoe?  Anyways...it was pure bliss.  Much better than most food at the hotels.    I had the buffalo chicken wrap.  It was amazing!  My husband had the patty melt and it was delish!  The portions are huge...great leftovers when you wake up all cruda the next morning!  Plus they are open 24 hours...so you can go in all drunk, lol!  Anyways, this place is awesome and funky.  they have red white and blue sugar granules that you can even buy!  The lounge is awesome and they have these cocktail servers that roam the restaurant in these funky black dressses and the servers in the restaurant wear funky polyester uniforms...pretty funny.  I loved the fireside lounge too!  So funny!  good crowd!  I love places like these! :)
817	1	What a little gem! We ate lunch here before heading back home on a Monday afternoon. We arrived just as they opened at 11:30AM, and the place filled up very quickly. It was packed and there was a line by the time we left.   We ordered the Nam-Prik-Ong, as recommended by Ming Tsai and based on the reviews, as well as the crispy duck over Panang curry. We had the coconut ice cream over sticky rice for dessert. The food was absolutely amazing!   The Nam-Prik-Ong was the perfect blend of spices - savory with a warm spice. It comes with an assortment of things to dip (cucumber, cabbage, green beans, broccoli, cauliflower, fried pork rinds), and you can order a side of sticky rice to go with it. It's a perfect little appetizer.   The crispy duck over Panang curry was the best crispy duck and Panang curry (separately) I have ever had. The duck is pan fried and has a tasty crisp on the outside and is tender and moist (without tasting fatty) on the inside. It wasn't gamey and tasted better than any chicken I've ever eaten. The curry was deliciously made with just the right amount of creaminess and spiciness.   For dessert, we shared the coconut ice cream over sticky rice. The ice cream wasn't too sweet or overly coconut-y. The sticky rice was warm and "marinated" in a coconut milk mixture that gave it the tiniest bit of saltiness that complemented the ice cream beautifully.   We went for lunch and there was a buffet for $9.99 per person. We decided to eat off of the normal menu because we wanted to experience what all the hype was about. We ended up spending a lot more between the two of us, but it was well worth it.   The only thing I wish could've been different is the quantity of food. Although we were full at the end of the meal, it was so yummy that we wanted a few bites more. But that's probably just us being gluttonous.
754	0	04/19/12 DINNER.  What misery. And sadness.  After nearly 1.5 years of living in Las Vegas, this has to be one of the WORST meals we've ever had here.  We used to go to the Pink's in LA a bit, as we lived in LA for a LONG time up until our move to Vegas in Dec 2010.   So we expected SOME quality.   Boy were we wrong.   And even with a $15 coupon, it was WAY too expensive. RIDICULOUSLY expensive.  Never again.  I had a polish/pastrami "classic" thing, SUPPOSEDLY with swiss. (Swiss air?) Spouse had a "baja" dog, or some such (he was like "HOW did they remove ALL flavor from jalapenos?") and some polish thing. All were just awful.  The fries were way too salty. Virtually inedible.  Very sad, that we can't get the Pink's of yesteryear. (Then again, we've heard sad rumors about the original, too, but we can't vouch, as we haven't been in so long.)  So avoid this joint, if you know better!  PS And you know what the WORST thing about this is? This franchise of Pink's is run by Block 16 Hospitality, the same people that brought to LV the following restaurants: Holstein's, LBS Burgers, Barrymore, Public House. I've been to 3 out of 4 of those, and have been from "quite pleased" to downright "in awe". So this failure in their portfolio should be jettisoned IMMEDIATELY!
1470	1	This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas, is away from the strip madness and the food!! Oh my God!  HUGE delicious portions! Come in with an empty stomach and be ready to fill it up with amazing flavorful food!  The staff is friendly and the restaurant has a nice vibrant atmosphere, it can get very busy and noisy, especially on Sunday's Brunch.  WARNING Healthy junkies, nibblers and pickers may not be able to handle so much goodness!
1781	1	Amazing burgers and fries! Headed over from the MGM for some lunch and the wait time wasn't crazy at all. We ordered a Shake Stack and some cheese fries. My favorite part of this burger was the mushroom Patty...soo delicious! A lot of people mention how the crinkle cheeses fries are amazing and YES THEY ARE!  So, if you're looking for something savory and mouth watering, check out The Shake Shack!
807	1	I've been looking forward to coming back here since the first time I was here. Brought 5 other people with and strongly urged them not to order the Chicken n Waffles as I had to have them again, but wanted to see (taste) some other offerings lol.   As others have indicated the portions are HUGE! Many doggie bags were assembled last night.   Chicken n waffles are excellent! (Chicken is bone in). The waffles have big pieces of bacon inside!  The fu fu looking Kiwi watermelon lemonade is delicious. (I went with the adult version -a shot of vodka)  Round the table there was meatloaf pasta - delicious...the hammered pork loin - Amazing!....the stuffed meatloaf -awesome!...and finally the breakfast crab cakes ...best crab cakes I've tasted!    After our order was taken a plate of huge glazed biscuits arrived with a delicious peach preserve and honey butter.    I'm here for a couple more days, I be back for breakfast later and then await my next trip to start working my way thru the balance of the menu.   Great service, delicious food, priced right, huge portions...do it!
394	0	Beware of Mafia Charge!!!  The food was ok, but overpriced.  The service was awful. At the end we had an extra charge on our bill of $5.86 When we asked the waitress what this was, she laughed and said it was the mafia charge.  According to her all restaurants in the miracle mile shops charge this extra fee.
1489	1	This place is worth all of the hype. Great service, full bar, and HUGE portions!  Our server was a doll (although I can't remember his name).  Sage Fried Chicken Benedict is incredible!  That was the best fried chicken I have ever had. Hint: portions are huge so share!!!
306	0	Vacationing in Vegas, I got excited that i saw there was a White Castle located on the strip. For those of you who don't know, the west coast remains White Castle-less and i'm glad that it remains that way.  Unless, you've had one too many cocktails or a yard of a margarita in need of say (1-100 burgers) to satisfy your hangover needs. It tastes just like the ones available at your local Vons/Safeway Freezer section. Save your money for other delicious foods in Vegas.  While i'm sure many people dream of pursuing a "Harold and Kumar" type of adventure (especially because its in Vegas. So why not?) Save your money for gambling or find a better adventure.
811	1	If I could eat their Fried Chicken Benedict ever day I would.  It was incredible.  Loads of fried chicken, eggs, mashed potatoes, and biscuits were piled on this plate and covered with the most amazing sauce.  It is easily large enough for 2 average people to share (Or one really really hungry person to attempt).  This thing was a monster.  I was starving when i went in, and I love to eat.  I consider it one of my greatest skills.  This plate of food was too much for even me to handle (but it was so good I kept eating until I hated myself).    The restaurant itself was nice and the bar area where we ate was pretty quite.  Definitely will be back the next time I am in Vegas.
384	1	Had the Hawaii Maui steak and it was freaking delicious. Cooked and seasoned perfectly. My friend had the burger and salad which was also good. Great place to eat if you don't want to spend too much money on the strip and still have a good late night meal
536	1	FOIE GRAS FOR A CALIFORNIAN  Anyone who's read my profile knows my love for foie gras. Because of the California ban on foie gras it is very difficult get this delicacy. After the ban the last time I had foie gras was when Psycho Donuts in San Jose were giving free foie gras donuts. Yesterday on my last night at Vegas I came here for dinner. There were two items I had in mind: 1) Hudson Valley Foie Gras 2) Beef Wellington. I waited in anticipation for both items. The first dish was the foie gras. When I took a bite of this foie gras it reminded me when I last had foie gras at a California restaurant after the ban - it was at Boulevard in San Francisco. I took my time eating this foie gras. I cut the foie gras into thin slices. I placed the thin slices of foie gras with the bite sizes of pumpkin waffle. This provided a typical contrast of savory and sweet texture. I treated this foie gras dish as if it was the main dish. The main dish the Beef Wellington takes about 45 minutes to cook. I never had Beef Wellington before and it was worth the wait. The pastry had that golden crust. The beef was cooked perfectly medium rare. Some people think a steak that is medium rare is too red. I never understood some people's fascination of a well done steak. For the amount of money you pay for a great quality steak why destroy the quality of the meat. What I love about the Beef Wellington that it's only cooked one way - medium rare only. Chef Ramsay is making the statement that customers have to adjust to him and not the other way around. The customer is not always right. Overall having dinner at Gordon Ramsay Steak with a chance to have foie gras was great way to have dinner on my last night in Vegas.
1976	1	Hands down the best burger in the east. I went there at 5 5 p.m. Not a lot of people. I ordered a chicken mushroom something something better but they gave me turkey something something Burger when she was still good. But turkey scares the crap out of me, so it was interesting. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place
1741	0	ZERO stars.  Here's my story..... 4 nights in Vegas for the Rugby Seven's Tourney.  Decided to ease up on the nightly $200 dinner bill and go for a burger with the wife, daughter, sis/bro-in-law and their infant daughter.  We get seated after waiting 15 minutes (restaurant was not even half full).  Sit down and waitress ask for our drink orders.  I order an orange shake and a water.  water comes out in a few minutes. She takes our order.  We wait ten, twenty, thirty minutes. not one thing comes.  We would have made a huff, but our kids were there and Redfoo from LMFAO was sitting next to us, so we let it slide for the moment.  Now we watch Redfoo get his food, eat it and leave, and three tables around us get drinks and appetizers going.  Finally, flag the waitress (who clearly didn't give a rats ass about customer service) and ask what gives?  She says, "Oh yeah, i think the ticket got stuck in the machine.  it will be out in a few minutes".  30 minutes later, the bro-in-law leaves and our food comes out.  The guy who brings out the food yells across the room to the hostess up front.  "IS THIS 21.  IS THIS FOR TABLE 21?"  as he starts giving our food to another table.  We say its our food and tell him we've been waiting over an hour for our food.  He says, "no you haven't"  the ticket says 26 minutes."  Idiot.  So we get our food, they forget half of the order and my daugther's meal was left out.  We wait another 10 minutes for my daughter's food to come.  Still haven't gotten my shake.  For the first time since she took our order, server comes buy and we tell her, we've waited over an hour for our food, our order was wrong and items were forgotten.  She responds, "I guess the teamwork isn't working today." whatt????  Then she says, "well you still want the shake?"  Never an apology, or acknowledgement of our waiting so long.   After all the waiting, our food was not good at all.  Just average fair.  Would have been better to go to McD's.  Oh and I finally got that shake. After my meal was finished.    I will be sharing this with the corporate folks and the Palazzo.  It was shameful and those who run this business should know that their staff is going to ruin their business.
937	1	The saddest awesomeness thing happened here .... I came to vegas alone and I told the cashier named Jarde that my bday was comming up in a couple of minutes she was super nice I kid you not she went to the back and gave me a free Ice cream ... Dude this is amazing costumer service! Give this chick a medal or something   Thank you!
825	1	Stopped here on our way to the airport. It was the best food we had all week! Considering we had paid $125 each for one mediocre meal, getting great food here for $25 for the both of us was awesome. We started with the tuna kimbap and both had the spicy ramen. The Kimbap was outstanding and the ramen was perfect. And the dried squid!!!! Amazing
1124	1	Went there for my wife's birthday celebration and enjoyed their wonderful brunch menu. Everything from start to finish was spot on. Our waiter Doug went out of his way to ensure our experience was amazing. His service and personable touches added to our enjoyment.  Nice atmosphere,  Excellent food, and Impeccable service. What more can I say? Thank you for a memorable time!
1539	0	Better than hometown buffet but still nasty food. They have the chocolate fountains but they use very cheap thinned out chocolate that doesn't even dry on your fruit after dipping. Two stars for the cotton candy and ice cream, that's it. Will never come back to this place.
1438	1	My husband and I came here on our last day in Las Vegas, and had been waiting since we planned our wedding and seen them featured on Triple D. We ordered the Oxtail Fries which are absolute heaven. Only need to caution they come loaded with jalapenos, and my husband isn't extremely fond of them ( i love them) and accidentally ingested a few pieces since they were covered by the delicious melty cheese gooeyness and chili cheese oxtail mixture. Not greasy, well balanced appetizer, wish there was one here in FL!. We ordered a burger each, he ordered the Kikki and I got the Miyagi. Both medium, served pink in the center, but not raw or bleeding, perfectly cooked. Meat still had the grilled taste, wasn't over seasoned, over all the burgers were well made. Definately favorite part was the fries, I was sad I didn't have room to try those yummy milkshakes listed, maybe next time!
1842	1	What can I say...I absolutely love this place.  I have been here so many times and have eaten thru the menu probably.  The kalbi burger is by far my fave...the kimchi and spicy mayo...yummy.  I also love the $3 pickles as a starter...and they have boba.  Awesome!  I probably go to this place because although some of the servers this is their first job and need a little coaching they are supernice and its open til 2:00 am most days so another plus on my list.  We live in Las Vegas, the 24 hour place, but too many place close way to early and if you go to eat around 9:00..whoa bad attitude people.  This place is nice too, cause you don't have to trek thru a mob of smokers and bright little machines to get there.  Told you I love this place. :)  My only wish is that they mix up the menu a little more with more specials to suit the season and local ingredients.
679	1	AMAZING.  Period.  The food was excellent, the service EXCEPTIONAL.  Never have we been treated so well, and given such attention.  The wait staff was amazing, and went above and beyond.  My wife and I joked that they must have mistaken us for someone else.  Our waiter, Ted, was the best we could have asked for, and my wife even hugged him as we left!lol   I was so happy, I even felt compelled to add to the already large tip.  Seeing Gordon Ramsey there himSELF ( Yes, it happened! ), was an added bonus (though we overstayed our welcome playing paparazzi ) !!!   It was an experience we will never forget.
254	1	About my fifth or sixth visit here, has never disappointed. This time I sprung for the Kobe burger, with spinach, Bleu cheese, peppered bacon, and a red wine and shallot sauce. Burger was cooked perfectly and tasted succulent, juicy, and buttery. Loved it!  Also had the  fat fries with dipping sauces. They were very good as well. Can't wait to return when in Vegas next.
735	0	If you want to be squished by hundreds of sweaty strangers with out even room to dance then come here. The restaurant is nice and I like the atmosphere the club has but Tao needs to seriously crowd control they let too many people in too fast, I was over it after 30 min. Not to mention the quality of people we ran into, maybe it was just random but this fat drunk Mexican literally feel on top of my girlfriend. My GF playfully smacked her ass when she got up. Apparently she didn't like that and started charging at my GF then tried to swing at her. Held back by all of her friends she finally stoped acting dumb and went away. I latter saw the same girl trying to dance on the stage where the bouncer kicked her off for being to raunchy. Thursday night might be better but I won't be going back. I've heard marquee and XS are much better clubs.
439	1	We come to Vegas for many reasons, and a visit to Secret Pizza is always on the list.  White pizza...you must try it!  Free refills on soda.  Good service.  Beer on tap.  Galaga game.  2 pinball machines (I always leave 2 quarters on the glass for the next player).
1769	0	Stayed at LVH for a convention - it is Okay at best.  Room was clean, TV channel quality was poor and food was good.  Would only recommend if you want to stay close to the convention center.  Staff was friendly, but nothing stands out at this hotel except for the proximity to the convention center.  Must be why it is no longer a Hilton
869	1	I'm disappointed by a lot of breakfast joints, but this one was AMAZING.  If I could I would eat here everyday.    I ordered the Sage Chicken and Waffles, the portion was literally bigger than my head and was the best tasting chicken and waffles I've ever eaten.  Also, the waffles were stuffed with full sized strips of bacon.  Disclaimer : Everything brought to the table was dressed with a sprig of sage, so maybe sage is just their thing, but it's delicious.
85	1	This is an over the top unique restaurant..that "nails" it on almost everything....and I'm giving it yelps highest grade...but I'm not certain I'd ever return. Its almost an exhausting gastronomic experience....I walked away from here completely satisfied....very very full.....yet almost mentally drained. Its a really happening place.  Its noisy...dark..hustle-bustle. we didn't really care for the atmosphere...not relaxing at all....our table was very close to the waiters pick up station..constant commotion going on.... the food is off the charts terrific...... .Christopher,our waiter, was very very good. Knew the ins and outs of the menu. Even in the frenzied atmosphere he took the time to walk us through everything we needed to know. Drinks are robust and made perfectly. the bread is almost a meal onto itself....he explained what we were getting.....soooo good! as apps...the british ale onion soup,the blue crab soup and the Caesar salad got high grades. My wife had the fishermans grill/lobster,mussels and scallop mix and loved it. my son,daughter  and I each had the roasted beef wellington...fantastic! Christopher explained twice why we didn't want beef wellington for 2..so we each had our single portion. you can't make this at home! mac and cheese side dish was fabulous. you must save room for the sticky toffee pudding for dessert..we shared....almost puts you in a sugar induced coma. All this comes at a high price but we all left here happy. this is definitely NOT your fathers old stodgy steakhouse.
328	0	Absolutely disgusting! I'm currently in my room at 1:30am on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend and I can't sleep because of all the noise above my room!! I don't know is there some sort of walkway above, but there's constant rumbling of foot traffic every 15-20 seconds. The reason I'm here for one night is because I'm here for 5 days but my regular hotel was sold out on Sat so I booked a room here because it's a holiday weekend and I couldn't find anything else. Thank God I'll be checking out in the morning and spending the next 4 days in a nice hotel.  This place is absolutely filthy and it stinks!! There is what seems to be blood stains on the wall next to the bed. There are stains on the ceiling?!! The fire alarm has holes in it and quite honestly, it doesn't even have the occasional light blink indicating that is operational LOL the carpet? Don't even get me started. The thermostat on the wall wasn't working and I kid you not, I had to bang on it a few times for it to fire up. Talk about ghetto. Oh, and I forgot the tons of shady people around.   This is probably the dirtiest room I've ever stayed in. The sad thing is, online they list a $14.99 "resort" fee. This is a resort??? The room doesn't even have a refrigerator?! I called the front desk to inquire about that and asked what sort of amenities did they provide to consider themselves a "resort". The answer I got was, "it's not a resort fee, it's a cleaning fee" LOL Since when does a hotel charge a "cleaning" fee? Isn't the room cleaning always a part of it? I travel all over the creation, a lot, and I've never had a "cleaning" fee tacked on to any if my stays anywhere, ever!   Please do not let the positive reviews on here sway you to book a room. I promise you that you will be disgusted and it will be a waste of your money! Believe me. The audacity of this hotel to charge over $100 for a rundown piece of garbage of a room! This is Las Vegas and even the $60 rooms in downtown absolutely blow this "hotel" away. This is LV and Palace Station definitely needs to get with the program! The rooms are so dated and filthy that I wonder how this place is staying afloat in the plethora of hotels that is Las Vegas.
350	1	Best shake I have ever had in my life. Enjoyed the cowboy shake as recommended by my server and ordered the Rossini burger medium rare. Skinny fries, zucchini, onion rings with house made ketchup.  Chipotle aoiloe, pesto and spicy ketchup. Everything is amazing here and the service was great! Our waiter had fabulous recommendations. I like how you can order the sauces individually.
76	1	I don't eat much Thai food.. came here purely because of the hype from online reviews, and realizing I've never been to a Thai restaurant with such acclaim.  Plus this was one of the few times I had a rental car available when visiting Vegas.  Fresh and marinated raw prawns with chili paste.. what a great and unique dish. The serving came with 8 large shrimp that I shared with dining companions, but I could have polished off a plate of these.  I also loved the crispy fried duck served with a congac based curry.  Again, another unique dish to me and I couldn't get enough.  We had other dishes that I can't complain about, but these two were clearly the standouts.   One thing I would mention, the spice level was not nearly as high as I assumed. We ordered "medium" and my next go round i would go high as I felt there wasn't much heat at all. That didn't take away from the fact that I really enjoyed my meal here.   Prices are very reasonable for what you get. This is a very good choice to take a break from the flashy casino dining.
1709	0	I went to Senor Frog's on a weeknight. There were not many people there. I sat at the bar and ordered my food and drink. The service at the bar was prompt and my food came out quickly so no complaints for bar service. I ordered a beef burrito that cost 19 dollars. I ordered chips and queso and two margaritas. I expected to get a burrito with rice and beans like most Mexican plates. The burrito came out, it was very big but it had no sauce on it and no rice and beans For the price, it should have rice and beans. The food was not bad, just ok and the burrito was a little bland. The two margaritas came in small plastic cups and tasted like a fruit slushy, they were watery, very sweet  and very weak on the alcohol. All in all, my bill for one burrito, one chips and queso and two tiny, weak margaritas in a small plastic cup came to a whopping 55 dollars before tip. I realize that prices are higher on the strip but this was way too high priced for what you get.
1817	0	I just returned from a stay at the Mandalay Bay for a birthday getaway. The hotel is lovely, the room furnished beautifully and very comfortable, but the buffet so so so sad and underwhelming for such a nice hotel. Service was slow and unfriendly, had to ask for steak knives, had to ask for drink refills, no forks for crab legs, it was empty in the dining room which might have been a clue on a Saturday night, the shrimp had the look of freezer burn, the prime rib cold, the desserts looked like a Hometown buffet or Golden Corral, the buffet selection was small and nothing stood out, really surprising for such a nice hotel.
706	1	What a great place. It has it. The pizza trifecta: cheap, delicious, and open late.  The employees were all also upbeat and friendly, and when we accidentally dumped an entire jar of red peppers (make sure your lid is closed tightly), they warmed up another slice for us without hesitation.   My only gripe, it was unreasonably cold inside. I am not sure why. But it was freezing.
184	1	This place was a bit of a surprise. I was not expecting so much flavor from the basic white cheese slice. Yeah it is tucked away down some hall took my group about 20 minutes to find it. We were walking right passed it. But that single slice was worth it.
64	1	This is the first of 3 reviews I will hopefully post for Thomas Keller's Restaurants.  While probably the least popular of his culinary trifecta of Bouchon (vegas & yountville), French Laundry, and Per Se, starting off with this restaurant is nothing to be ashamed of.  If you scroll down to Seth W.'s review, I was also in his party of 12 that drank the absinthe and easily had one of the best dining experiences of my life, with good food, good drink, and excellent company.    The first thing that showed me this is a quality restaurant was the excellent, attentive wait staff.  Starting off with a very knowledgeable waiter (who else can explain why castrated chicken is more tasty and juicy?), to a well-versed sommelier who taught us the history of absinthe, we were taken care of through the entirety of our meal.  We started off with an amuse bouche of salmon spread with salmon cooked a few different ways (smoked, pureed, etc.).  Had I known about this, I probably wouldn't have ordered the salmon tartare appetizer, as this tasted a little bit better.  The consistency was such that you could take a butter knife and spread it across the biscuit.  The salmon tartare starter had a similar taste, except it was surrounded by bits of hard boiled egg.  I can't say that it did or didn't complement the tartare well, but the amuse bouche was definitely better tasting without any extraneous tastes that the egg brought.  Never fear though, as I'm confident that I got the best main course of the table.  The Epaule de Porc is a braised pork shoulder with glazed root vegetables, celeriac remoulade & pork jus (quoted from the menu).  In everyday speak, this is the most tender pork that exists.  Saying that it melts in your mouth is an understatement.  Think about a warm tasty porky marshmallow that gives you feelings of the first time you made love, but not as short lasting.  That's about as close as I can put into words to describe this amazing dish.  Putting it in perspective, having this kind of amazing meal for under $100 in Vegas (not to mention in the Venetian) is quite a steal.
1686	1	Just go here and try one of their burgers, you will not be disappointed!   We hit this on our way out of town based on my friend's recommendation and I am thankful we did. We shared a Kiki burger with an egg and truffle fries which were both bomb! Also ordered the pork belly slider which were damn good as well.   As Samuel Jackson said, "Mmmhmm this is a tasty burger"  Can't wait for them to open up in LA!
788	0	I recently visited Golden corral 2641 in Las Vegas Nevada for breakfast with Dad.The place was nice and clean however the  customer service was horrible. I was ignored several minutes while standing at the  omelette station by the employee  Eva that was in charge of it . The Manager (Tomas) was also behind the counter  so I asked him, did they make fresh eggs? He replied yes, so I stood there waiting patiently for Eva to ask me what I would like . The entire time of me standing there, she never looked up and gave me any eye contact even after me trying to say good morning and addressing her by name. The next thing I know another employee whom I assume was on their lunch break walked up to the counter. She immediately acknowledged him, start speaking in Spanish and started making  his omelette. Still giving her the benefit of the doubt. I thought maybe she didn't see me so I stood directly beside him. She completed his omelette gave it to him and turned around and walked away.  At this point I realize I was being blatantly ignored, so I turned to look for the manager that I initially saw behind the counter. Before I could say one word  planning just to ask him if Eva spoke English he goes into a rant saying "we're working here ,working here" This is a new promotion...I guess referring to the omelette station that I didn't had no idea was new or old . I was in such shock the next thing he said to me was so what kind of eggs do you want? At that point my appetite was ruined I felt disrespected. I looked for my dad who was just about to sit down to eat his food and told him to leave it. Then asked the manager immediately for refund. After realizing his mistake he tried to apologize but was too late. I then name and he just gave me a card with no response I asked his name again and then he blurted out "Tomas" this is no was to handle A Dissatisfied customer. The problem would've easily been resolved had he said the station was not open, when I asked him did they make fresh eggs. Eva or Tomas could've simply said the station wasn't ready.
643	0	I will NEVER go back. My brother took me once and we had a great experience. My husband and I purchased the groupon deal for the last time and wow it was awful. We sat in the crowded room with oyr table about a foot away from the next table, so there was no privacy. We sat THERE FOR 15 MINUTES until I asked one of the many people walking back and forth if we could get some service.  The couple sitting next to us got so upset they left. We had already paid so we decided to stay. The drinks were EXTREMELY sour, like it was the bartenders first day. The mashed potatoes had no flavor and all the meat was cold, chewy and flavorless. Worst money ever spent on a restaurant. Pick fogo de chao or texas de brazil instead.
1559	0	Extraordinarily disappointing. Burger patty was dry and overdone, but bacon was cold and cheese not melted somehow. Fries were underdone, with cold dry potato in the middle of the wedge. The $7 milkshake will not be getting any praise from Vincent Vega. At $35/person, it's steakhouse prices in highchair googie decor. Service was friendly, but slow, though they were good about refilling water. The brioche was very tasty; I wish the burger lived up to it.
437	1	OK... Anytime you stay in Vegas and eat at the same place for breakfast 4 days in a row, it's 5 stars for sure.  We would have gone everyday just for the coffee!  Asked about it and heard it was a "four bean proprietary blend".  Damn good!  The food was just amazing as well as the service.  Between our group we managed to try a lot of the menu although my wife got hung up on the quiche of the day which happened to be Florentine each day.  It was creamy deliciousness.  Also sampled were the sourdough waffles, sausage, bacon, corn beef hash, scrambled and over-easy eggs, french toast.  Every bit of it was absolutely perfect.  I would go back daily if I lived in the Palazzo or Venetian!  Bless you Thomas Keller...
1963	0	So I was really excited to try this place.  I heard Pink's is the #1 hot dog, better than gray's papaya in new york.  I seriously couldn't wait after I saw that Planet Hollywood had a Pink's there.  i decided to order something different.  It was the hollywood dog or something like that..  I didn't like it at all.  I didn't want to try anything else because I paid $16 for a hot dog, fries, and a coke.  They get two stars because I liked the fries.  My friends told me I would like the los angeles location better.  Hopefully it is better than Las Vegas.
1488	0	The only reason why me and my crew came in here was because the guys wanted to watch football and there was enough seats to sit 6 of us. I feel bad because for the server because we were a larger group and we really didnt order much.   My boyfriend ordered a smoothie, which was so gross we sent it back after 2 sips. Our friends got spinach artichoke dip which I had a chip and the chips were like border line stale if you ask me. My other friends had a sloppy quesadilla which I could smell sitting 2 seats away from them.  I ordered nothing. I would never eat at this place. Overpriced for fatty, nasty food.
446	0	I placed in the weekly slot tournament and won $50 in credit. When I went to the cashier to have this added to my card,  I mentioned that the credits came at a great time since my sister was arriving later in the week and we could use the credits then.  Her response indicated she had heard what I said.  She said something like  "oh that will be fun"  and I went on merry way.   Flash forward a few days and I go to use the credit.  There is no credit balance on the card.  I go to the cashier cage and a different cashier is working.  I asked her what was up andr she tells me that I have until midnight the same day as tournament to use the credits.  I asked how I was supposed to know this and told her that I had even told the other cashier I planned to use them later in the week.  She apologized and told me to take it up with the casino host.    I was totally unimpressed with the casino host.  She told me that due to gaming commission rules she could do nothing to help me or reissue the  credits I'd won.  I told her that this is very unfair as I had no idea the creditswwould be revoked so quickly.  She said the rules are posted at the tournament.  When I asked specifically where they were posted she didn't know,  but advised that I ask the promo people running the tournament.    So I went back the next week to look for these rules.  Guess what? No rules posted.  I asked.  An employee hosting the tournament told me they could grab me a copy.  But it confirmed what I thought.  I didn't remember seeing anything about rules.   What irks me is that we're talking a $50 prize and it's not even cash! It's credit! Awarding me the $50 credit would be nothing to them. I live next door to the Riv and have spent lots of money there.  So you're going to haggle over $50 credit when the rules aren't posted and the cashier never mentioned a time limit when I gave her the perfect opportunity to do so.    I used to like the Riviera.  The place can go to hell now for all I care.  I would have called the gaming commission on them,  but it's just $50 plus the place will be blown to bits soon enough.  Way to go Riviera.  I'll never return.
1967	1	I absolutely looooove this place!!! Everything that I have ate here is absolutely delicious..even the tap water tastes good.   Ive stayed at the Venetian for one of my most recent trips to Vegas for a week..and just about every meal I had was from the Grande Luxe!  What Ive had:  appetizers: Mini chili cheese hot dogs: hit the spot after a night of dancing and drinking at Tao, but dont u dare eat em if u cant hold down ur alcohol and food! Duck pot stickers: very yummy, dont really taste the duck meat due to the spicyness of the Hoisin sauce.  Asian Nachos: such a cool play off regualar nachos. the chips are made from wontons and there is peanut sauce which is spicy and sweet! there is also wasabi cream which is daring but sooo good. This appetizer is good with a beer!  Burgers: The Max Burger: Omfg!! burger effin heaven, I swear to you! Angus beef topped with short ribs, bacon, mushrooms and cheese! So delicious, I wanted to order another..but there was no way I was going to finish it!  Santa Barbara Chicken Sandwich: Delicious, but nothing will top the Max Burger.   Entrees: Jamaican Pork Tenderloin: The presentation is so pretty, you dont want to eat it, but then your senses kick in and you start grubbin! With every bite of the tenderloin top off your fork with a little of the sweet mash potatos and mango salsa..your tongue will thank you! Fried Chicken: An overload of delicious chicken tenders!  Crispy Caramel Chicken: Spicy from the thai sauce, but there is caramel that blands down the kick of the spicyness and makes it a bit sweet.  Chicken Royale: if you want to play it safe, go ahead and pick this. simple and delicious.  Pizza:  Margherita: Yummy with a huge beer! The pizza bread is very thin and super crispy.  Simply put, the food is delicious. Be a risk taker and order something that sounds daring with the fusions of sauces, you wont regret it.  The presentation for all the plates are lovely.  Super Pro: Open 24 hours!!
1068	1	Shogun burger was DELICIOUS. The seared foie was so buttery and went so well with the poached Asian pear. I asked to have my burger cooked mid-rare and it was perfectly cooked.  Kiki burger and Mr. Ho's burger were also very good.   Also got the oxtail chili fries. Personally, I thought the beans in the chili were just barely undercooked but it was awesome besides that and three of us killed the plate.    Service was great. Even though the place was packed, someone was always making sure our water was filled and we had everything we needed.
1710	0	This place has gone downhill.  The food tasted so bad.... I think I may have better food at Denny's.  Everything was so mediocre.  The dessert station taste like box made. And I can't believe there was not one single fish item in the entire place.  The food was either so picked over or what left on the table was just stale and old.  If you want to throw away your money, then this is the place to do so.  Not cheap.  $75 for two pple.  I'd never go back again.  EVER!!!!
29	1	This place is ridiculously good. I do not hunk that I've had anything bad here.  The burgers are great, my favs are the spicy miso, and the kalbi. The pork belly and duck buns are great. People really like the oxtail chili fries, but they are not my favorite becaus the chili is too sweet and I can't really taste the oxtail a which I love. Service is always decent, never have a complaint
716	1	Has to be the Best Korean BBQ in Las Vegas.  From the time we entered to the time we left everyone and everything was the best. Service, food  ect... Their were four of us we ordered the 4 people meat lovers meal. From the start the food was excellent and then it just keep coming and coming, If you walk away from this table hungry you must not like Korean food. Their is probably more then enough food to feed 5 or 6 people.  This is a must for Korean BBQ. I will be back.
1998	0	I have been looking forward to trying this place for a long time now. And with a girl trip to Vegas for my birthday, what better place to go to have my birthday dessert.   What a huge mistake!! It was by far the worst service I have ever had and what makes it so bad is we only had dessert. First off, we waited about 20 minutes for our waiter to take our drink order, then another 10 for that to be served to us and then another 30 minutes for our desserts to come out. To top it off the dessert wasn't even that amazing. But what made it such a bad experience, I mean enough for me to write a review because I don't ever write reviews but this one I couldn't let go. The wait staff, they were horrible, no customer service skills what so ever. As we're sitting there waiting for our bill, the waiter finally comes to give it to us. Then sitting there waiting for him to take it, we see him clearing off other tables and taking dishes to the back and he doesn't come back out. So I flag a waiter down and ask him if he could get out waiter, which he said he would. Still no sign of him. So I finally walk up front to the hostess and ask him can we please pay our bill, we've been sitting there waiting for 30 minutes. He says he will get our waiter. Still no sign. Then we ask another waiter and finally he takes our bill to the back and gives it to our server. Finally 10 minutes he walks out with our credit card slips. Guess what bud no tip for you!! That was by far the worst experience in a restaurant that I have ever had!!! Never again will I go there or allow any of my family or friends to go there either
758	0	if you want CHEAP ROOMS this could be the place ...just be prepared to bend over for anything else...breakfast buffet is mediocre at best and it's $16.99...go next door to the Peppermill and get REAL FOOD Slot and poker pay backs are the worst in the valley, best described as rob and pillage because it certainly isn't gambling  I'm a local and I know when I'm getting shafted, video poker min pay in $20 w/ max play to qualify for a $1 draft beer....in over a year I actually broke EVEN TWICE!!!  I now play elsewhere and experience true Vegas Value
1233	1	Not so secret as people would say but the pizza is really good.  Open 24 hours and I found it to be the busiest after club hours.  There will be a long line through their hallway and out into the hotel.  I won't wait but I've seen people wait over an hour for the pizza.  Thin crust pizza with a tasty sauce and they never skimp on the cheese.
567	0	My beef isn't so much the  actual taste of the food it's more like the portion and cost.  I know, I know after all this is Las Vegas so everything is priced three times what it usually should cost. It is completely beyond me how people can charge this much for food. During this particular visit I arrived with seven other guests three of which were menly men (like these boys could eat). One of them even asked which is your largest meal and the waiter responded with Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice. Judging by it's miniture size I doubt it actually had twenty vegetables it was probably named that cause it cost close to twenty dollars!   Next up is the Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich it is braised red pork in a chinese flat bread. It was tasty but a bit on the salty side and was almost half the size of my iphone!   Then my hunny and I split the Shrimp Mojo per the waiter's recommendation. It was packed full or flavor and mouthwatering good. It was $16 for eight pieces.  Again my complaint isn't towards the taste or quality of the food mainly the portions. The service was good we were seated within 10 minutes for a party of eight while other places had hour long wait times. The restaurant decor and arrangement was very chic and trendy. But after loosing my butt in the casino I doubt I'd be able to pay for a substantial lunch here!
1719	1	Amazing food, very flavorful, and incredibly helpful service who advised against some items we were getting that had a similar sauce and then recomended something else that was amazing. And the price is so reasonable! Definitely worth the cab ride off of the stip.
1866	1	Oh my goodness!  We drove here under recommendation of a friend.  It is amazing!   Non descript little strip mall on the edge of town.  When we pulled into the parking lot at 12pm,  patrons were doing nothing short of running to the door to claim their table.  The crispy rice appetizer was a rocket fire explosion of flavors.  We had the Tom Kah Kai soup, Pad Se-Ew with chicken, Crispy Duck with Chili Mint Leaves, all washed down with Thai Iced Tea and Singha and finished off with the delicious banana roll with coconut ice cream for dessert.  As my dearly departed father would have said, "this meal was a religious experience!"  Highly recommended!
1321	0	Just left Rustler's Roost, chose it for my birthday dinner I should have just gone to Texas Road House! The food is better, cheaper and the service is 100% better. The view was nice but not worth the time we spent driving there. We had a young snotty waitress that completely ruined the experience for me and the food was subpar! Much better choices out there for sure. Put a damper in my birthday but over it and looking forward to the rest of my night.
559	1	Can you say the BeSt PiZzA eVeR!   If someone never told you about the secret pizza place you'd never know this place existed.  Luckily I came across a video on YouTube and had to give this place a shot.   When you find this place it's very small inside. Maybe enough to seat 4 or 5 people. The pizza is excellent and surprisingly not many were here.   Out of all the places we ate on our recent Vegas trip this was one of our favorite.
943	1	Dining at Bouchon is always a special treat! I have yet to have the pleasure of coming here for dinner, but I'm a big fan of their weekend brunch. I've celebrated my birthday here and took the day off from work to do so - which was totally worth it. They do not take reservations for brunch, so you have to come and give your name, but I've never waited too long. Even during my bachelorette party weekend, where they said the table for 8+ was 45 minutes, we got seated in 10 minutes. If there is a wait, they have a cute little seating area and usually pastries for you to sample. They have some daily specials, like a quiche of the day or soup of the day. Their quiches are perfectly soft and pillowy on the inside. I'm actually not a huge fan of their chicken & bacon chive waffles, but since everyone else raves about them, don't let my opinion stop you. One of my must orders is a side of fries - though I do wish they gave slightly bigger portions of ketchup and mayo, I always feel like such a classless fool when I have to ask for more. If you're with a larger group of people, the pastry basket is always a nice way to start off brunch as well while your entrees come in. I was so hungover and sick during the morning of my bachelorette weekend, I couldn't enjoy eating here. I sustained myself on ginger ale and their tasty cauliflower soup, while i watched everyone enjoy their mussels and steaks. I did have some of the foie gras that was ordered for the table - amazingly silky, and a big hit with all the Californians. I was so jealous of everyone's enjoyment, my husband and I ate here the next weekend so I could enjoy Bouchon like how it's meant to be enjoyed. I actually prefer sitting inside since it's beautifully decorated. The outside patio is right next to the pool and some bodies are just not meant to be looked at while you eat brunch. Their champagne cocktails are all really interesting, so you don't have to be basic and get a mimosa, there are a ton of other options. One of my favorite things to eat here is actually complimentary - I love eating their warm baguettes with the mustard on the table while my husband prefers spreading jam and butter on it.   I will  definitely be back here several more times and hopefully get to enjoy their dinner menu soon.
682	1	We went here in our September 2012 trip. We had a reservation ( you likely will not get in without one) and still had to wait about 20 minutes for our table.  Not a big deal. We both got strong drinks, very well prepared.  The bread assortment was very  nice.  I had the Beef Wellington.  OMG, I am still dreaming of this dish!  It was perfect to the last bite.  My husband had the short ribs and he said they were very good as well. We wanted to try a dessert but didn't have room.  But we will next time we go in May. Don't pass this place by, you will regret it.
654	1	Egg & I is a super-cute local breakfast joint away from the strip. It gets SO crowded and busy on the strip for breakfast/brunch whenever I've visited, and it makes people even hungrier and grumpier while waiting. My advice? Take a cab or drive over to this place for a REALLY tasty meal.  My group and I of five people waited about 10 minutes for a table. Once seated, we were serviced immediately. Food only took about 10 minutes to be ready, and the staff were very attentive and worked together to address our table's needs. They have a little egg sign that you can flip to the sad-face yellow side, which indicates that you're in need of something. We did this a couple times to test it out, and it worked! Lightning fast.  Great food, great service. I recommend the Biscuits and Gravy! The Ranch Potatoes (their regular side of potatoes) are very flavorful and filling. A must have. Oh, and their Banana Nut Muffin was soooo sweet and moist!  I just may be back when I'm in town. If I can get outta bed next time after a long night, that is. Tehe.
70	0	The customer service was very nasty!! I will never go here again and will pass the word on to friends and family!! I never would have expected to watch some as whole throw my food into the bag because the cashier as whole didn't confirm that it was and order to GO!  Got into a verbal confutation with the lady who threw my food in the bag!!.. Since I didn't have bail$$ I let her keep her teeth...  A little encouragement to the as whole lady please find yourself another job if you're unhappy with the Hot Dogs business!! The Original Pinks is in Los Angeles Ca. a much better place to go and eat a hot dog and know the customer service there has better class.
1565	1	Chef's burger?  Delicious. Sweet potato fries with cinnamon honey something?  Sweet 'n tasty. Deep fried mac & cheese?  The undergrad in me was drooling. Hazelnut nutella milkshake?  I will take 8 lactaids because you cannot keep me away from it!  I haven't had a milkshake in ages (stupid lactose intolerance).  But this was worth popping one of those chalky white pills every few sips.  I am looking up the address in San Francisco because I am not waiting until the next time I'm in Vegas for the sweet or savory goodness that is Burger Bar.  I hear there's one in St. Louis too.  (Oh, and I have a little crush on Hubert Keller.  Shhhh - don't tell.)
973	1	I did my research on this place and did the whole only order from the back side of the menu with all of the northern specialties. And holy moly. Those garlic prawns were AMAZING. I forever will need them in my life and have been ruined for all other crispy, garlicky, Heaven infused crustaceans. The crispy duck with curry was also a favorite, I could eat that daily. I'm so coming back here everytime I'm in vegas. I'm addicted.
1371	1	As much as I love In-N-Out, I have to admit that Shake Shack is better all around. The fries, the hamburger meat, the cheese, the frozen custard shake are made of quality ingredients and deserve recognition. Price point is higher for that very reason. I'm so addicted to the perfect fries! Cheese lovers can order a side of cheese dip to keep the fries crisp. The shackburger left me wanting more. I can't wait to try the shroomburger and the shackstack and their hot dog offerings. Please come to Los Angeles!
1270	1	Its a value and great deal.  That being said, a foursome (2 couples) with eats and drinks is going to be about $120.  $40 bucks a person, if you want to be like super stuffed.  Otherwise, you can probably get away with $30 a person (tip not included with that price).  Great food, great service, great AYCE Korean BBQ in Vegas.   Been here 2x and still loving it.
1965	1	The food is great along with the customer service.  When you go there you have to try their banana nut muffins they are the best. It is not overpriced and you will get a lot of food for your money.  Friends come to visit and I have recommended this place to others and they too enjoyed it.
1663	0	Sorry, but I Love Burgers isn't that great. I should have known better when I saw all of the signs in the mall that stated "Tell them Dante sent you for 15% off your bill" and the place was only 20% or so full, but I wanted to give them a try and was unfortunately unimpressed. While my wife liked her hot dog, my burger was devoid of any real flavor which was a real shame as the gorgonzola-topped burger should have been fantastic. The brioche bun was nice and soft but they really needed to season the burger and no amount of salt livened it up. The garlic parmesan fries were run of the mill thin frozen french fries and the garlic and parmesan came on the side in these little containers. Really? Why couldn't you have tossed the fries in it? I wouldn't be surprised if this place was closed the next time I come to Vegas.
430	0	Not impressed by this buffet at all, but at least I got it for free! They had a large variety of foods, much like the newer buffets around. Sadly, their quality is severely lacking.  The carving station was very inconsistent. My prime rib was dreadful, but my bf had a good piece. I also made the mistake of trying some ham, which was salty and dry. As for the seafood section, the crab was actually okay... not awesome but okay.  The shrimp cocktail was not fresh at all though. They had smoked salmon which can't go wrong at all.   Desserts: the only thing that appealed to me were the coconut macaroon cookies. The ONLY good dessert. That's really sad because I love sweets.
872	0	Wow.  You would think that this place would have a warning sign saying "Everything here is great....except the buffet".  This place was remniscent of an old-folks home in the midwest.  Bland, boring, really not good food.  I felt like I was on an all-you-can-eat crap-fest.  Trying to choose the least bad thing there.  Looking back, I should have asked for my money back.
1512	1	We were in Las Vegas for a mid-week business event and stayed at the Venetian. We made advanced reservations before arriving in LV through Open Table.com. Everything went smoothly and the hostess called each time (we ate two dinners there) to confirm reservations the day of the meal. Both meals were pretty much flawless. We each seemed to especially enjoy any of the nightly specials which happened to be hanger steak, fresh corn salad and some other goodies.
1005	0	The food is OK. The price is a little bit higher than outside but you should appreciate they can bring authentic Chinese food into the middle of a casino. The major problem here is that the place always asks how you are going to pay BEFORE placing order. It suggests the place may suffer from ample unpaid checks at ... Bellagio. So show them your wallet BEFORE placing orders to calm them down.
1726	1	Granted, I've only eaten here for breakfast, but what a fantastic breakfast it is.  The croque monsieur is easily one of the best things I've ever eaten, and the fries here are some of the best.  The specialty omelettes here are also out of this world - it doesn't seem like there is really that much that can be done with eggs, but Bouchon manages to find a way.   I love the atmosphere here early in the morning - its fairly empty, the staff is formal but still relax and not stuffy or annoying, and it all equates to a very nice, very relaxed breakfast experience.    A breakfast here also won't break the bank...it's not exactly cheap, but I'd much rather spend my money here than at a place like Grand Lux or Hash House.    I can't wait to try this place for dinner.
1790	1	Obviously I was not disappointed! Me and my husband are obsessed with Hell's Kitchen so of course by some miracle I was hoping to see Chef Ramsey or Christina... maybe our next visit. The fury wings are soooo good! The sauce is spicy but sweet and who doesn't like blue cheese. The uber cheese burger is perfect.. and you have to try the gooey fries (we never wanted it to end) I would definitely recommend coming here and coming back. But I also want to try Ramsey's other restaurants in vegas.
968	0	They really need to re-evaluate on having a buffet.   With so much history, at the MGM Grand and this is what they have to offer. It's rather disappointing and I would say the worst buffet in Vegas I've had in the 10 years I've been coming to Vegas. Either they don't listen to the reviews or they just don't care. To me it's ruining MGM's image and unacceptable.  The food quality is below par with the exception of the desserts which is slightly better. Everthing was either overcooked, or dry. The atmosphere reminds me one of those $11.99 Chinese buffet. Never again.
1392	0	The Creme Brulee is the only reason I give this 2 stars.  The Prime Rib Is tasteless and tough.  The Shrimp and Crab Legs were water logged and tasteless.  The Lamb had no taste whatsoever.  Pretty sad that hospital food had more going for it than the Buffet.  I am glad we used our buy 1 get 1. I wouldn't pay full price otherwise.
1134	1	Finally, after years of living in Vegas, I finally had the best Thai spot in town (some say best in country), and it totally lived up to the hype.   Saturday Night - take note of the hours before heading there. They open at 5:30pm and close at 10pm. But don't assume they won't get business for the few hours. Arrived at 5:20pm and there stood a 60+ person line outside while the parking lot was filling fast - and don't worry, there's a LOT of seating so you'll be seated quickly after opening.   Inside looks like a big dining hall. One area has normal tables for small families while the other area  can probably accommodate for your party of 100. Also interesting and didn't find this out til later, they take reservations!  The staff works so well like an oiled machine. It's impressive how good they are in their knowledge of the menu and they're so polite too - especially when they're dealing with such large and loud groups.   The food was delicious. As like many others, this cuisine was new to me and I didn't know what to order. But reading through probably 100s of items on the thick menu, I went with the infamous Garlic Prawns ($27.95), Panang Curry with beef ($11.95), and Khao Soi ($10.95) and it was all so good. Flavors from lime, coconut, egg and curry mixes are such a unique taste that I have to come back here for more.
1416	0	Not to be some snob, but we ate here out of sheer convenience because Vegas was exceptionally busy during New Years and every restaurant was slammed for dinner.   It was not good and some things such as all the salads were beyond sketchy.  I can't think of anything that I enjoyed when thinking about it now.  There was a good variety of options, but the quality was pretty low.  The decor is kind of old grandma style and the only saving grace was the service.  Also, it was Holiday pricing, so we paid something like $40 each.  I would think $15-$20ish is fair pricing for this spot.  I say skip this place if you're ever here during a special holiday pricing period because it is absolutely not worth it.
1485	0	Hungry to the point where our stomachs were starting to ingest themselves, a few friends and I stopped into I Love Burgers for an early dinner. We were greeted by a super friendly hostess that quickly seated us and gave us menus to peruse. I noticed that each burger was priced around $15 and didn't include any sides, which struck me as being a bit odd. No matter. After a few minutes browsing their delicious-looking options, I ordered the Standard with Pepper Jack cheese and mushrooms, as well as a side of Parmesan fries. I figured $6 for a side of fries was pretty steep, but just having entered the US mere hours earlier I had a hankering for the classic all-American meal, so I ponied up the extra cash. My friends must have thought the same thing, as we were all giddy with excitement for our meals.  Not long after, our waitress brought out our (massive!) dinners. It doesn't say this on their menu, but a "side" of fries is actually an entire basket. Had we known, my friends and I would have easily split them, so take note! As for the food itself, the burger was tasty, although not $15 tasty. As for the fries, they were a bit too thinly sliced for my taste, but that's just me.  I know what you're thinking: "Sarah, you're giving them only two stars, so there must be more to the story. Out with the juicy details!" Alright, alright. I just needed to write this preamble to collect myself. Brace yourselves...  When I went to the women's washroom, there was no soap in the dispenser. Gross, yeah, but it happens from time to time. What made me feel REALLY grossed out was that the staff use the same bathrooms as the customers, so how could they not notice the soap was out, unless...? No! I don't even want to entertain that thought. Of COURSE food service workers wash their hands after using the restroom, right? RIGHT?
1394	1	This isn't your usual Korean BBQ place, no all-you-can-eat here.  But the portions are generous, the staff is courteous, and happy hour just makes everything better!  We happened to arrive during their happy hour, and we were greeted promptly.  Clean, classy atmosphere.  The music is a mix of top 40 and big Kpop hits.  Service is prompt and courteous.  Nothing really noteworthy up to this point.  Then the food arrives -- everything was well-seasoned and good quality.  The meat we ordered was never chewy, a welcome change from Tofu Hut.  Their prime kalbi was surprisingly marbled, definitely my top pick of the evening, followed by the green tea/mango cheesecake for dessert.  If you're looking for tapas-style Korean BBQ, Gangnam certainly makes the grade.
1115	1	Best Thai food I've had, and I live in L.A.  Unlikely city, unlikely location, a nondescript strip mall on a run-down stretch of Sahara Ave., but oh the food!  I've been here several times now (try to make a couple of visits every time I'm in Vegas, sometimes twice in a day, it's so good).  Great beef salad, excellent curries, grilled chicken, wonderful homemade ice cream.  We've tried a lot of different dishes and everything we've had was great.  Ask for recommendations from the waiter also: that 's how we tried the catfish and the Nam Kao Tod, crispy rice with pork sausage.  They also have a great selection of Northern Thai dishes that you rarely find in other places.    Once, we tried to order the mango with sticky rice but they warned us beforehand that the mangos weren't fully ripe and gave us a sampling of the mango to test whether we really wanted it.  It tasted OK, perhaps a little less sweet than a ripe mango in-season.  We decided to go with some of their home-made coconut ice cream instead.  I think this anecdote really shows the detail and care they put into their food.    They have a lunch buffet on the weekends (geared more toward the locals or the typical tourist) which I wouldn't recommend, but you can still special order dishes during that time.  They apparently have a world-class wine list as well, but I haven't tried it; with the heat of Thai food, I always find myself craving a beer.    Despite all the fancy, big-name restaurants in the city, the meals I have here are always the most memorable.
1326	0	HERE'S MY IDEA OF A PERFECT NIGHTCLUB.  1. A huge dance floor. When you really wanna get down, you gotta be able to move freely without having to worry about getting an elbow to your chest or face.  2. Bar. You also gotta make sure the bar itself is pretty big and the area around it should have ample space as well.  3. Easy acces. Why the hell would you have to go up  a set of stairs just to have to make it to the main dance hall? You got female club goers all dolled up in their stilettos complaining that their feet hurt just making the journey from their car, waiting in line, and then stairs to deal with. The worst time is when its time to go. You got blisters already just from dancing (that is if you had any kind of room whatsoever), AND if you are drunk, you can easily be on youtube the next day.  4. Have plenty of bathrooms. It's bad enough you have to wait to get in to the club, but you have to wait in line to go take a leak as well? Yes when you drink alcohol it gives you an awesome feeling. Only problem is, it goes right through your system. So alleviating that should be convenient and not time consumming.  Music, DJ's, bouncers, and bartenders should always be givens. From what I saw these were very good.  Overall, I would rather go to a club that was not as popular cuz at least you can walk around somewhat freely and have enough room on the dance floor to be able to do "The Dougie" or the  "Gangnam Style" dance. Im pretty sure some fire codes were violated based on the zombie like overcrowding. Im surprised there are not more fights and/or lawsuits resulting from pushing, shoving, and groping.   So if I had a couple million in my back pocket, I would build my own club and call it "The Warehouse". LOL.
749	1	We were able to get reservations for 7:30 on Saturday only a week or two before. The koi soy (beef tartare) was excellent, as was the the mashed jackfruit dish (very surprising!) and papaya salad (which is very spicy but quite authentic. The khao soi was all right but not amazing. The whole fried catfish with basil was great, and the northern larb was pretty good but again not exceptional. The wine list is truly something, and there are plenty of other drinks as well. Service is very good and friendly and the prices are not bad, especially for vegas.
1298	1	My girlfriend and I were really intrigued by this place because we're big fans of GR's tv shows and just the overall hype on his cooking history. This is probably the most excited we've been entering a restaurant. We expected top notch food and we got exactly that! Best onion rings ever and the burgers were insane; they had a very unprecedented flavor. We are definitely going back when we are able. 100% satisfied. From the atmosphere, to service, to the food... everything was what we expected and more. Burgr is fantastic and you should really try it. Freakin sensational.
125	1	Awesome burger! The prices are well worth it! Fresh and delicious. I ordered the blue cheese burger and it was to die for. The truffle fries are also delicious and will feed up to 4 people. We also ordered the pork belly steamed buns and OMG! Must try this place and will definitely go again!
1500	1	I went here for my last meal in Las Vegas and I was impressed! I had the Big Breakfast which comes with 2 eggs, enormous container pilled high of  frites (fries), brioche toast, 2 sausage links, tons of bacon, orange juice and  coffee or tea. It was more food than I could ever imagine!   The best part was the strawberry croissant that came first before the breakfast.  I have never had this good of croissant besides Paris.  It came split in half with the strawberries baked inside topped with cinnamon and  a studel like topping almost like a coffee cake!  I believe they baked it like that split in half!  It was AMAZING!!!! I had died and gone to heaven! It was so flakey and good! I could only eat half and based around for others to enjoy.  I did the same with the huge helping of bacon and massive container filled with fries!  Everything tasted perfect and was the best breakfast I had in a long time.  This meal was not cheap at $21.95 but was worth it! Service was pretty quick overall and decor was really nice and decorated cute.    If was a fab last meal for Vegas and we took off for the airport.

It's not a very authentic Chinese restaurant but their Mexican cuisine might be better. We sat for 15 minutes before the server even came by and the restaurant was pretty empty. I tried the fried dumpling which was alright. It was fried like a crab Rangoon, with thick dumpling skin. The swallow a cloud noodle is just Hong Kong style wonton noodle soup. It has egg noodles, bok choy and wontons. The noodles were fine but no taste, the broth was bland, the wontons were mediocre. When pigs fly is a braised pork stuff steamed bun. The filling is sweet but decent. The rou jia mo sandwich is a more traditional dish that I was looking forward to. It's also a braised pork filling in a toasted bun shell but I was Sadly disappointed. The filling was so salty that it didn't even taste good. Not what I was expecting.
1481	1	Okay I have to update my review. We were a bit unhappy at first because of the wait and the poor service, but the manager soon noticed our situation and made amends. First, they brought us some salmon rillettes, pickled olives compliments of the chef. They were AMAZING. I'm not a big fan of olives, but I couldn't stop munching on them. For our entree, we ordered the lamb and the crispy pork belly. The crispy pork belly was their special, and it was the finest we've ever had. It came with an onion cream sauce, which was incredibly flavorful and just perfect with the pork. Unfortunately we had no space for desserts but I am definitely looking forward to come back again!!   Not even done with my meal and already unhappy with my experience here. We made a reservation, but had to wait 15 minutes for them to clean up the table, and anther 20 minutes before we got to order out food. And that's only because my friend waved the waiter over. This is not the type of service you should have at a high end restaurant.
219	1	My husband and I went there on 2/19/2014, our last "full" night in Vegas this past trip.  I always wanted to try it but noticed it was rather pricey so I wanted to see what the consensus was before dishing out big bucks.  It was well worth the price though that's for sure.  We are already thinking about what we are going to order the second time around.  Our waiter was Dennis, don't recall the assistant's name but they were both nice.  We did wait a little bit though, which if the prior reviews didn't boast about the excellent service I probably would not have noticed and would have chalked it up to them being very busy.  Prior reviews were correct about the bread selection- all very good.  The salt on the butter was the BOMB!  We skipped appetizers and opted to save room for dessert.  My husband ordered the bone-in rib eye and I had the American rib cap.  For our sides we selected the mac/cheese and the truffle fingerling potatoes.  Let me just say- I could have just had the sides as my entree because they were both excellent.  Rich and decadent.  I almost felt guilty eating them.  But they were so good.  And let me say the day after they were just as good.  The American Rib cap, which I never heard of before, was excellent.  8 ounces seemed small but it was packed with flavor and with the sides, well I couldn't finish it.  That too tasted good the day after.  My husband's rib-eye although BIG was just alright.  Meaning we've had bone-ins before.  His had a little more gristle than we prefer so he's thinking he'll go with the rib cap next time.  For dessert, we went with the sticky toffee pudding even though I was a little reluctant after trying the one at BurGR- it was a little too sweet for my taste.  But the one here, at the steak place, was excellent.  It wasn't too sweet at all.  We are ready to go back on our next trip.
1541	0	If you've been to a Vegas buffet this is nothing near it. First impression when I came in on a Tuesday night-- wow ghettttooooo! I've been to many buffets, but the food didn't look appetizing at all. I went for a plate and there were a piece of chocolate cake still stuck on it. Im not normally a germaphobe but that made me check twice on the cutlery. It was soooo busy and packed, it seemed like a refugee camps' cafeteria where people haven't eaten before.   Good:  - good variety for what u pay for - cotton candy - Chocolate fondue  Would I recommend waiting in a long ass line? No way. But again, good value for the money: steak (dry medium rare), ribs(dry), ham (dry), spinach n salad bar fresh. Dessert omg super sweet.
255	0	There's nothing really wrong with the cafe, for breakfast, except for the outrageous prices. $4.50 for a beverage? Give me a break. I'm willing to pay a premium price for a nice restaurant experience, but I demand better food, better service, and better/unique ambiance in return. Cafe Bellagio offers none of those for its sky high prices.   The Crab Cakes Benedict was pretty good, though not work withe $20. The plain Belgian waffles were also pretty good, but not for $10--the secret, I think, is they use a lot of vanilla.   Service was OK for a restaurant of that size. There was a wait of about 15 minutes to get a table, but that was at 10AM on a Saturday with a rush.   If it's a weekday and you insist on eating at the Bellagio, go for the buffet. Better deal, I think. Otherwise, go off strip. Your wallet and stomach will thank you--first when the bill comes, later when you have to pay it.
1492	1	Where to start. We had been up for roughly 24 hrs when we sat down at midnight to eat dinner. I was whatever a combination of sick, shitfaced and sleep-absent is and got a drink with ginger beer in it that tasted fantastic and immediately made me feel worse; this I was expecting so no deductions. The in house dj had his system up far enough to interfere with those ears trying to make sense of the Bellagio fountain coordination a mile away but no matter-he was great and had enormous hair. I got a Kobe burger with chips, garlic pickles , and something red on it and it was perfect despite the waitress leering at me when I asked for it well. The french fries came in an exciting metal pail that apparently had been heated in an oven since earlier in the week, and didn't cool down prior to us leaving. We also had the mini tacos which were small but no points deducted as the menu called them effing small so whatever. The girls and their black dresses left for the Marquee Club and a petite Indian man who would welcome them into his private tent and Robert and I ordered another drink and went to find the Cosmo poker room which doesn't exist.
572	1	I had the farm burger, great combination of creamy yolk and crispy duck great bacon over a medium well patty(my preference) and a side of truffle fries! The aioli is really delicious. They update their menu too. so the next time you check this restaurant, You may find a new burger on the menu
416	1	Came in around 5:30 yesterday and it wasn't as busy like the last  time I came into this restaurant but it was steady. A very friendly young Asian lady had greeted us and had asked us to give her a few minutes to set up a table. From the way it looked there was only a couple servers and the hostess who had greeted us. Our waiter Kevin was amazing and explained everything on the menu. Our food came out in a perfect time and everything that we tried on the menu was amazing. My group and I had oxtail, miyagi, black&green, and the lamb burger.  This place is a must try. Every time I'm in Vegas, I always enjoy their food! Very friendly staff and amazing food.
538	0	Food: 1/5 Service: 3/5 Cleanliness: 4/5 Decor & Style: 5/5  The quality has really gone down hill since I first started coming here when it first opened. The pizza tasted like a frozen pizza from walmart as well as the wings. The deserts are not as fancy as they use to be. The location is still great so I may just stop by for beer next time, never the food! The place was approximately 75% empty at 6 o clock on a Thursday. I remember back then it was crowded and I had to wait in line. I really question how long this place will stay open!
1087	0	This place was gross and dirty. The waitstaff/hostesses were kind of rude and gave us the run around on how to get a table/how long it would take to wait (they had plenty of open tables but made us give our phone number and told us to wait 25 mins for a text and then come back, we got the text 30 seconds later LOL whatever). I've been to the real location in New York and this one is nothing like it. The decor is rundown and ratty and the place is DIRTY. I'm talking visibly grimy (picture the cleanliness of an older McDonalds). Both my food and my companion's food were gross. Please spare yourself the somewhat high price and go somewhere else (if you're craving breakfast food later in the day, there's a great waffle place across the street by Bally's). I gave 2 stars because nothing terrible actually happened but it was very bad.
1632	0	Their attitude is so rude, make sure you don't go to this club if you are Asian! I wear according to the dress code with a dress-like shoes. They kicked my group out because of one pair of fking shoes with a very rude attitude. The other white group got in with sneakers. Like WTF!!! Make sure you never book for Tao if you want to have fun in Vegas.
1748	1	I was really in the mood for a burger so I thought I'd give Gordon Ramsey's Burgr a shot. It was just before it opened and I joined the line instead of being discouraged by the line. Good thing I did because when it opened we were seated quickly. I ordered the Hog burger and also tried the onion rings and parmesan fries. The burger was not dry and had a nice taste. The fries with the topping were also good. However the star for me was the onion rings. The breading/topping was crisp and did not fall off the onion. It made each bite delicious. I do regret not trying the milkshakes. One of those came by our table and wow it looked good... next time.
493	1	Bouchon Las Vegas is one of my favorite restaurants and yes my passport actually has stamps in it.  I've eaten at Bouchon in Vegas probably six times now; we stop in whenever the opportunity presents itself, most recently this spring.    While I've had better cuts of meat, the steak here is seasoned in a remarkable way.  I was warned about the gnocchi being different, ordered them anyway, and liked the change of pace.  The stand-by's on the menu will always be there for you so take a listen to the specials because this is a Keller joint and it's truly going to be something of the moment.  I'm not an oyster aficionado so I can't speak with authority on the raw bar.  Go through all the courses -- I had a wee slice of lobster on a few mixed greens here that re-defined salad for me.  The macaroni and cheese is heaven in a cast iron miniature pot.  The pot du creme may be a little better than the chocolate mousse, but I think the flavor changes.  If you have a sweet tooth, do not be afraid or ashamed of having two desserts, preferably one with the house-made ice cream..    Breakfast here may well be the most you'll ever spend for bacon and eggs and it's worth fighting through the hangover and waking up early for it.  The eggs florentine were to die for and do not skip the pastry.  Definitely sit outside while you sip your fresh OJ and coffee as it's probably the only non-recirculated air you'll be able to enjoy in Vegas.  I really like the look of the place; the zinc bar and the tiled floor has a certain charm to it, but it might be a little cliche.  I like the fact that you have to wind your way through the Venetian to find it; it's a hideaway that provides you a two hour respite from Vegas.  The dining room is open, though, and as such is crowded and noisy.  You're not going to have any intimacy here.  I have had both stellar and service that wasn't so much here, but at it's worst I wouldn't say it detracted from my enjoyment too much.    If you stay away from the expense-account-only menu items and the prestige wine list, you should be able to have a positively memorable meal at Bouchon.  You will almost certainly do worse if you're in Las Vegas for any length of time.
1667	1	This place was great! I gave it 5 stars because everything we sank our teeth into was phenomenal and our service was amazing. My boyfriend got the Rising Sun burger, I got the Golden Standard. Both were awesome. I think his may have been better just because it was so different and all the flavors were spot on!!! I got the oreo shake and he got the peanut butter/banana....both tasted delicious.  Our waitress, Kristine, was top notch. She was fun, polite, perky, and adorable. That kind of service is what we LOVE. We will definitely come back on our next trip to Vegas :)  If I could change one thing it would be the loud music...I mean, it was pretty loud, hard to have conversation over that loud of music during dinner!
1024	1	Delish. 2nd time I've been there and just as good as the 1st time. Got the special, Hobb's Pork Loin Benedict and it was uh.maze.ing!! Oysters were fresh and so cold. And their bacon is the best. EVER. Everyone delivers solid service and the food won't disappoint. Will be back next time I'm in Vegas. #obsessed
1338	0	Must be a nostalgia thing. The wife always wanted to try one as she had family who loved these. Neither one of us can figure what the draw is. Not real burger tasting or anything to make it stand out. If you just want to say you had one then give it a go, at least it's not real pricey.
1317	0	Thirty bucks for steak and crab legs. Kinda pricey and easily overpriced. I will not be back. I'd rather go to Luxor and Excalibur all day for 15 bucks more. I'm glad this was a business trip and was expensed. Here's the breakdown of why: -The "steak" was rediculously overdone, which I can see why they would drown it in sauce. -The Roast Beef at the carving station looked more like a ball of muscle that they literally just lopped off of a cow. "Yeah hey, lets not trim that, it looks fine... I mean sure it looks like the meatball alien thing from Duke Nukem, but people love nostalgia. -The macaroni and cheese was creamy, but only tasted like macaroni. Why would you serve this? -The Crab legs... are sliced through with, what I would assume was, a table saw. Nothing screams delicious like small bits of crab leg shell in the steamed-out, dried up, blade-o-grass thin, crab legs. After I had essentially given up on the "great eating" here, I decided to try the lower quality "food". Who the hell makes sweet and sour chicken with chicken nuggets? Oh these guys do. And the nuggets? The only thing they were missing was a Double Bubble Branding. I didn't want to delve into why whys and hows, because it wasn't going to be pretty, but here it is. I hope that MGM can rise from this mess and actually produce decent food again soon.
1707	1	Who would've thought that foul mouthed, temper flaring, firecracker of a chef Gordon Ramsay could pull off such a MEOWWWW of a restaurant?!   I dig it. I dig it a lot.  You'll fit right in with that super short, tight black dress and sky high heels. The in-your-face, very sexy red throughout the restaurant grabs your attention as soon as you walk in. Up the coolness factor by ordering cocktails on an ipad and then have a hard time choosing what to eat because everything LOOKS. SO. GOOD.  And because we're in Vegas, it's just fitting to have a steak cart presentation tableside. Drool over every cut of MMMeat available from steaks to Wagyu to chops. (drool over the sexy patrons as well!)  The bone-in ribeye is marvelous, darling! simply melt in your mouth. Of course, being the foie gras lover that I am, I ordered this as a topper for my steak with bone marrow sauce. (I'M GOING ALL IN!) The grilled asparagus and mashed potatoes are excellent sides. The bread basket? don't be a fool to skip it.   Sleek and stylish design with a high-energy vibe, phenomenal service and oh la la EVERYTHING?   Gordon Ramsay, you've got one helluva restaurant.
1985	1	Highlights of milkshakes: #Cereal bowl: vodka, fruit loops, cap'N crunch! #Birthday cake: vodka, birthday cake crumbles, sprinkles #Coffee & donuts: coffee ice cream, cake donut, malt, kahlua, chocolate espresso beans  Each order come in 2 cups: the milkshake cup (fancy glass) and then the flowover milkshake cup (metal bowl), so by buying 1, actually you will get 2 separate cups, meaning: BUY ONE, GET 1 FREE.  Huge portion in each cup. Very delish,  just right sweetness for my taste.  Billionaire burger $32: kobe beef, foei gras, port onion marmalede, trifee, trufle mayo. The most expensive burger ever, but interesting to try.   Service: 4/5 Guests: mixed, but mostly white Cleanness: 5/5 Area: strategic, crowded, in hip place (in front of marquee club- cosmopolitan hotel)
1839	1	Awesome place!! I looked this place up in YELP but was a little scared of the neon lighting and drinks shown in the first couple of pictures ONLY because I was traveling with my husband and our eight month old baby. Thought it would be more of a lounge than a restaurant. But I asked over at the Wynn where would they recommend a great restaurant for breakfast and they mention "Peppermill". I was then convinced and headed over. When walking in you can't help but see the neon lights and the purple furnishings. But once you actually sit down and your food comes to the table you enjoy the ambiance with the delicious food. Very good, would recommend and come here again!
324	0	Don't waste your time!!!  I was in a good looking group and skipped the line just to spend the next hour in a line to the over crowded mosh pit( No room to dance at all), then a pushy line to Tao Beach...no dancing....then back in a pushy line back to the over crowded main level, then to a 40 min line to get out!    We almost reserved a table...so glad we didn't!  The crowd often pushed right into the people at the tables.  There is nothing exclusive at all about Tao.  They obviously pay the celebs to come.  I gave it 1 star vs no stars because the staff was kind of nice and the girls in the bathtubs were hot.
1202	0	Horrible customer service one star because u can't leave 0! I am a local and I had heard they had a real gold drink so I told my friend let's go try it. Upon arrival there was a long line and I saw a hostess talking to a co-worker and she had a big stack of menus in her hand since she was so busy talking I went to grab a menu and she gave me a dirty look. I looked over the menu and had some questions but since her demeanor was so terse I did not really want to speak with her again. Then she proceed to come behind me and yell, "Can u move up?!" I said please and thank you as if to tell her to be nicer she ignored me. Then she went over and it seemed she was talking about me and my friend to her coworker. I told her im leaving and I asked her what her name was and I believe she said Miranda or something with an M with a huge attitude!! I left and then try to make reservations for gordon ramsey over the phone with the resturant line for cesaers and the woman was like uhh is that a bar and I said no its a bar and grill by the forum shops. maybe they should inform u better and she said snidely well it's still considered a bar i asked her to please transfer me over and she had me on hold forever by the time I walked to Gordon Ramsey it wasn't busy and I got sat right away I had a better experience there. Cesaers needs to step up there customer service in the restaurants!! Especially at Serendipty!!!
1419	0	This place is not very good.You get a 2for1 if you stay at TI which is all that it's worth, if that.  The food is cold and the only "fresh" thing I could see was the pasta made in front of you with choices of sauces/pasta.And the poor staff are not happy.Our guy never cracked a smile even when we try to make a little small talk.At least we didn't have to walk far to be disappointed.Oh wait, they did have fresh fruit (kinda sorta) so that was good if you like melons and pineapple.
337	1	Had the sage chicken and it was unique and very tasty.   I was in a hurry and by myself so I sat at the bar.  Service was quick and helpful with suggestions.  It was a little pricey but the portions and quality of food makes up for it.  I will definitely visit again.
1495	0	Went there  with Party of 10. Service was good(Kevin) but that was the highlight. Trust me that there is no way this restaurant can be considered good. It is a tourist attraction but that is it. No one in our party of 10 thought the food was good.  I wouldn't normally write a bad review but I have a feeling that management knows the food is bad (how can't they?) but just don't care. They're making money regardless. I believe most place that have substandard food, try but just can't pull it off. Rustler's is probably pulling in the cash and just couldn't give a crap which is what their food tastes like.
1232	1	The best Thai food I had in long time.  I started with Sa-Tay of chicken.  Very good pickle vegetables and a delicious peanut sauce.  I enjoy it immensely.  My girlfriend had the Tom Yum Kai.  She really enjoyed the soup.  I was lucky and got to try it before she ate it up.  I agree, the soup was great. I had the drunken seafood noodles with spice level of 7.  It was spicy but satisfying.  The food was delicious and the spicy sauce was incredible.  We came pretty late but service was still very good.  Definitely, will be back again.
1697	0	I decided to take my wife to @CaboWaboLV for an early Valentine's dinner since she is the biggest @Sammy_Hagar fan & has been dying to check this place out since it opened.   Before going I did my homework and read all the reviews that had been posted. After reading I was really surprised this place is still OPEN. Not too many good things being said.   We arrived on Friday night around 10pm and the house band had just started playing. Acoustic Soul-Las Vegas' Original & Only LIVE Jukebox. They play all requests-some good some NOT so good.   We were seated immediately with no wait even though the place was packed including the outdoor patio bar.   The menu is mexican food with a baja twist. VERY Pricey. We ordered Beef Fajita Nachos to start-The Carne Asada Entree & a 3 item combo with Hard & Soft shell tacos and a cheese enchilada. Ice Water all around. NO drinks this time:)   (However they did pour FREE shots of tequila when the band played "Mas' Tequila")   The service was a little slow it took nearly 30 minutes before we saw the appetizers and we spent most of the night chewing on ice.   The nachos were very underwhelming-10-12 soggy chips covered in cheap shredded cheese and sparse bits of beef fajita meat. 4 melonballer size scoops of (lettuce,pico,sour cream & guac) NO seasoning, no spice, no flavor just cheese. The complimentary chips & salsa are a much better choice.   NEXT, the entrees came out- The carne asada plate covered w/cheese, onions and jalapenos. a couple tortillas and a plate with (lettuce,pico,sour cream & guac). NO salsa!! Again with the cheap shredded cheese and the jalapenos were not even cooked just sliced and covered in cheese.   The fajita onions & peppers were way too much compared to the skimpy 8oz carne asada steak. The steak like the nachos had NO seasoning or flavor. FOR $20 at a bar I was really expecting something phenomenal.   The 3 item combo of beef tacos and cheese enchilada was alright except for the cheese enchilada which again used the cheap shredded cheese which didnt melt well at all and was tasteless.    The lack of seasoning for a mexican resataurant is really unacceptable and NO salsa with entrees no beans with the chips appetizer. :(    For 2 people to have an appetizer and 2 entrees-drink ice water and get slow service for $65 pretty disappointing to say the least:(
981	1	As a few Yelpers have noted in previous posts, the actual name of the pizzeria is Nico's, but I will always remember it as "Secret Pizza".When you walk by, it's easy to miss. But take the time and enjoy the many record album covers that adorn the walls. I busted a gut, for sure. That hallway will lead you to a pinball machine and voil!, you've found your pot of gold.   Staying at the Cosmo, my husband and I decided to take full use of our amazing room and bask in the glory of pizza on our balcony overlooking the Bellagio water show. In about twenty minutes, our pizza was ready and we were on that elevator so fast. The pizza was very good and a nice break from formal dining on the Strip. Highly recommended for those general hankerings for pizza in Vegas.
1378	1	Great HUGE food - Awesome Bloody Mary - Good service.  Had the Sage Fried Chicken.  We had to laugh when it came to the table...  It was a huge stack of waffles (with bacon sticking out around the edges) & fried chicken with a long steak knife holding it all together.  It had to have been a least a foot tall. The hot maple caramel reduction was very tasty and worked surprisingly well with the crispy fried leaks.  Make sure to come hungry and plan to share!
841	1	If you feel like leaving the strip and "venture" a little around Las Vegas, definitely check out the Hash House a Go Go. Not a cheap cab ride from the strip, but it's totally worth it. I love this place!  Portions are huge, but you can always take your leftovers, so stop crying about how big they are! They have a DJ so, if you want a quiet breakfast this is not your place, otherwise, you would love it, fun environment. Food is very tasty and fresh.
1181	0	This review is not about the food. We didn't get to eat any of it. It's about the service, or lack thereof. When we walked in they said "It's a 20 minute wait, but you can have a drink and sit outside. We'll call out your name." A while later they claimed they had called our names even though we were practically right next to the host stand. When my friend complained about that the hostess basically shushed her. Then we were completely ignored by the wait staff when we finally were sat down. No one stopped by to even say "I'll be with you in a moment."  We finally said "Forget it" and took our business elsewhere.
1043	0	I stayed in the Mediterranean Tower on a Thursday until Sunday at The Riveria. There wasn't a refrigerator in our room, the room didn't come stocked with all of the essentials for travel, the TV service in the room is lacking (HDTV with no HD and lousy low def lodgenet service), and we had two rooms we had booked to be next to each other, but they were not able to make this happen. However, the casino is very nice and the staff is very friendly, and there's a nice pool and a tattoo shop along with other shops. Just take note that the Mediterranean Tower is inexpensive, so expect to be a bit underwhelmed. The one thing that made my 3 star rating a 2 star was the unavailability of WiFi, which is crucial for someone like me. The WiFi was working great on our first night's visit, but then the WiFi network dropped off early the next day on my and my friend's devices, and I was unable to log on with my laptop computer. Certainly the hotel can provide better coverage, especially for someone who might have to remotely connect into work in the case of an urgent matter, and it would have also been nice to play music on too. Of course I was in an inexpensive part of the hotel, but I wouldn't stay at a hotel that didn't have reliable WiFi. I called the front desk to complain and they thanked me for reporting it, but unfortunately we were unable to get back on the WiFi network in my and my friend's room, and we were a good distance apart. I hate to say it, but I don't think I would stay at this hotel unless I was given a free night's stay in a better room with WiFi that will continue to work. Here's hoping they give me a chance to formulate a second opinion. ;-)
1589	0	This was my third time coming and I expected so much from my visit.... Boy was I WRONG! I made reservations and they ended up seating my family and I on a table that was Super wobbly.. FIRST the hostess was not friendly, SECOND the Waitress was not there to serve us for awhile THIRD FINALLY When we asked the waitress if we could change seats  instead of acknowledging us she called the Manger who "tightened the knob" but this didn't help at all explaining we couldn't move without having to wait... BUT WE HAD MADE OUR RESERVATION, not our fault. The waitress was prissy and rude. She didn't even want to serve us lemon in our water when clearly we saw another waitress passed by us with lemons....  Additionally,  when we orders fries with our meal.. They gave us Precooked fries that were sitting out for over 20min (we know this because we were sitting next to the kitchen) so the FRIES WERE COLD and MUSHY.  Unless they change management  DONT WASTE UR TIME COMING HERE.
1767	0	We met family from out of town here to eat (since that's where they wanted to go). I've had better, it wasn't awful... but I'm not inclined to go back.  Best things I had:  1) mini carrot cake complete with cream cheese frosting, it was nicely spice and how carrot cake is supposed to be.  2) peel and eat cold shrimp and snow crab legs. The crab was sweet, the shrimp were nicely flavored. They both tasted fresh and not fishy.  3) fresh fruit the melon, strawberries and pineapple were all juicy and flavorful.  Mediocre things: 1) steamed veggies....they were a little on the soggy side.  2) tiramisu cup, there was hardly any lady finger in it :( that's the best part!  3) cappuccino mouse, very rich....but a lot of clear brownish fluid was in a pocket in it....not sure if it just wasn't mixed good or what?  4) black beans, they're kind of hard to screw up :)  Could have been okay but.....  1) Chili Relleno. The cheese filling was good, but there was wayyyyy too much breading on it which did nothing but retain too much grease....if there would have been less breading and not as greasy this would have fallen in the category above.  2)peanut butter cream puff. Dry, kind of defeats a "cream" puff.  Yuck:  1) crab salad....I don't know if it was imitation crab meat, or old crab... but this was fish and gross...the crab was also rubbery.  2) California roll, ewww gross. I actually spit this out into my napkin. It was so fishy it made me gag a little before I spit it out!  3) mac n cheese pretty bland and gooey....I think maybe they made it with generic velveta?  So, that's the run down of what I ate, about all I could fit in my tummy. So, in my opinion stick to the peel and eat shrimp and crab :) Not sure about the other meats because I don't eat it.....my hubby said they were okay, not the best, not the worst. He pretty much agrees with me on the "Meh. I've experienced better"
1721	1	A friend of mine recommended it to me and we went to the location on West Sahara Avenue and it was delicious! This location was closer but still the service was great and food was on point. All the burgers have their own special taste. We had to pace ourselves. Their ketchup is something you have to try as well.
977	1	Good food, good vibes, & great customer service! I will come back here again. The bulgogi is very good! I really like the kimchi, it flakes the rice. The beef toro is amazing when you dip it in the sauces.   Happy hour is amazing. You can get meats up to $4 a plate!
1557	1	Someone told me this was the "best Thai food outside of Thailand".  With that kind of a  claim, I had to try it out.  I was in Vegas for a conference, so I made it a point to get over to Lotus and punched the address into the GPS.   We got there around 4pm, it was located off the strip.  When we got there, I was thinking "this is it?".  It was a HUGE, deserted strip mall, with a very empty parking lot.  All of the store fronts were plain and faded, definitely wasn't feeling very Vegas here.  You can't see into the restaurant, so we opened the door apprehensively and poked our heads in.  First thing you noticed is every square inch on their walls is covered with photos of celebrities eating there. The restaurant is pretty big, but was more or less empty when we sat down to order.  Admittedly, we didn't make the best selections in terms of gauging the true authenticity.  I had Curry Duck, my friend had Curry Tofu and my other friend had BBQ Chicken.  My 2 friends had never had Thai food before, so I sort of held back.  Had I gone with more experienced Thai food eaters, I probably would have ordered several dishes to eat family style.  But I didn't want to risk it with them, since the prices are a little higher and we couldn't take anything back to the conference with us.  However, the food was still great and both of my friends couldn't stop talking about how good it was, and how they had to bring their wives the next time.  My friend that ordered the chicken was stoked, since his order was huge, practically an entire chicken.  When we looked up from our meals, the restaurant, was packed!  Not a table in the house was available.  On our way out, I looked on some of the other tables and some of the seafood dishes I saw looked amazing.  I will definitely be returning here and next time, plan on trying many more, unique dishes.  NOTE: can't remember if it was Andrew Zimmern or Anthony Bourdain, but saw on TV that one of them went here and said the Northern dishes are their specialties, and to just order those.
260	1	This is it!  Michael Jackson isn't the only one.  This place is so great...every aspect of it.  What carne asada fries are to drunks in San Diego and what Paisano's Pizza is to drunks in Hermosa Beach, Grand Lux is to drunks in Vegas.    The beauty of this place though is that it is for classy drunks and not even for only drunks.  The food: perfection.  They have THE BEST Chicken Parm I've ever had. They use a number of different types of cheeses that add to the tastyness of it.  They also lighly bread the chicken making it more tasty.  Unlike other places where all you taste is fried batter.  You get the flakeyness and deliciousness of the breading here with the juicyness of the chicken.  Now let's move on to the next entree...shall we?  If you order Buffalo ______ at Grand Lux, it's a safe bet to be amazing.  Anything Buffalo is good here. Their buffalo chicken roll appetizers are some of the best appetizers I've ever had and their spicy buffalo chix sandwich just adds to the buffalo goodness.  Sometimes I order both and I may get a look from the waiter recognizing my buffalo filled meal, but all that subsides after the first bite.  Now to breakfast...  I tried their breakfast buffet here for the first time 2 weeks ago, and it was $15.95 and it included juice.  Very good breakfast selection of eggs, bacon, omelette station, fruit, waffles, etc.  The only thing missing was pancakes.  What i did though was made a nice dessert out of the waffles by taking some hot waffles and adding some of the chocolate chips they have laying around and put a nice dose of whip cream on top.  And if I'm feeling good, add some fruit.  They also have hash browns, which were some of the BEST hash browns I've ever had.  They weren't dry at all.  It was just great.  The greatest part is that they have 6 cheesecake factory cheesecakes (b/c it is the same company) and a whole bunch of other awesome desserts that I am sadly usually too full to eat.  I can't recommend this place more!
1223	0	Save your money and go somewhere else. This place is overpriced and the food is subpar. That 2 for 1 yard drink special is not a good deal or even a decent deal. You get two yard drinks in a souvenier plastic container for $40! You can find way better deals at any bar in Vegas. The food is so overpriced it's not even funny. Something like $20 for a quesadilla. If you like overy loud music and a party atomosphere and you don't care how much lousy quality food costs then you might like this place. Otherwise, I'd never go back.
494	0	There isn't really much to say about this place because I didn't enjoy it that much...but I don't really enjoy any buffets outside of vegas and for the price you paid I guess you get that 2 stars. Regardless...you wait in a long line(I'm assuming due to it's cheap price) and you can get a drink...I prefer you not to get a drink because you don't even get to refill it yourself and it's like 1.99 which is alright but flagging down your "waiter/waitress"just to get you another drink is kinda missing the point of Buffet? Anyway I'm not entirely sure on the drinks price but I think my friend paid around $11 for his lunch and soft drink so sounds about right.  Regardless I don't find any of the dishes memorable as they all tasted either too bland or too salty. I honestly don't know if i can really complain about it cause you shouldn't expect much but yea. The memorable part for me is that dessert you get to have cookies and cream, pecan, and 2 other flavors of ice cream and it's unlimited so that's something to look forward to even though it's not the best ice cream you'll ever taste but it certainly beats having only vanilla and chocolate ice cream all the time.  Anyway...my tastebud is spoiled so you can give it a try if you want but I don't see myself coming to this buffet any time soon.
403	0	One of the biggest disappointments in Las Vegas. The concept mixes Street Asian food and Street Mexican Food. The concept with "To Go" windows on two different sides for both cuisines is clever and I was thrilled to try this place as I love street tacos and I'm a huge fan of Jos Andrs. If he came to this restaurant to eat he would be ashamed to have his namesake on this venue between the less than average food and pathetic service. We ordered a few of the tacos at the window and it took THIRTY MINUTES for four tacos! The restaurant wasn't even busy. If it took street vendors that long ANYWHERE they would be desolate because no one would wait that long for street food! Totally ruins the whole point of ordering street food from a window- if we wanted to wait that long for food we would have sat our butts down in a booth somewhere. After the build up and anticipation from the long wait we were starving. I figured it's Jos Andrs so it will be worth it once we get the food- perhaps even up there with Kogi. Unfortunately, the food was terrible. The tacos were messy to eat, and somehow with all of the sauce and food packed into the taco, it still managed to be terribly bland and there was absolutely no flavor. Hard pass on this place!
583	0	Sigh... this was not the first time I've eaten here, however, it was the worst visit out of my two visits. Fortunately, both meals were free. The silver lining...  I'd like to give more than 2 stars but I can't. It was really more like a 2.5 experience, but I can't round up because the food was just that lousy.  The only thing that was half way decent was the prime rib, fruit tart, lemon meringue tart, and the stuffed sole. All of the warm items were cold...selections were dim...meats were all tough except for the ones that I just mentioned. Not sure what happened at the Mediterranean station. Why was everything doused in heavy curry spice?? Isn't curry more of an Asian spice?? The curried cauliflower and chicken were both awful. All that I could taste was heavy curry and no other seasonings..really dreadful dishes...the lamb and chicken kabobs were both dry and cold. The grilled squash was cold, slimy and tastless... I could go on and on about the other items that I tried, but I won't bore you with details, but I will tell you that the other offerings were similar. I didn't get around to the salad bar but I think I should have started there first...  I think that SMB is right around $40 per person sans discounts...it's definitely not worth the money. Quality nor selection are there. There are too many other buffets in Vegas that offer much better food at a better price. The Orleans is one.  In all fairness, I'm not a buffet buff, but this is about as bad as it gets...service was at least decent.
1994	0	Why oh why didn't I check the yelp reviews first?  Oh that's right, because I didn't dare risk using anything wireless during hacker conferences.  I hope you don't either.  But I digress.  Definitely watch the flashy handmade noodle show, both stretched and sliced off of a big brick of dough.  They looked appealing but tasted super bland, no matter what sauce or soup they put it in (we tried the beijing pork and black bean sauce specialty and the wonton noodle soup.)  I also got the taro boba (tapioca drink) and it had huge chunks of ice and was more vanilla tasting than taro.  I'm not hating on this place because it's "Americanized," I couldn't care less if it's not what people in Beijing eat.  All I care about is it TASTING GOOD.  Bleh.
1406	1	The pizza was delicious. The price , however was chocking, 5 bucks for a slice. After 2 huge slices I was still hungry.  It is better if you get a whole pizza for 25 bucks and is enough for 2 or 3 people, it is huge. The place feels like you are walking into a restroom, but the pizza's good. They make lots of $$$$$$
1677	0	i made the mistake of ordering the pasta prosuttio. took 3 bites the( pasta over cooked the meat undercooked and the sauce watery thin not thick like is should be) and asked for the check . asked for the mgr on duty  waitrer says he isn't in right now he is out of the restaurant. the waiter never even offered a replacement. 0 for 3 come on- its sad when the highlight is I got the faster drink refill ever
664	1	I would just like to say that I love Costco pizza. I mean, its thin YET it has a nice crust. I don't like dough-y pizza? Not sure if you guys catch my drift. Any who - found this place on yelp and since I am a 'new york style pizza lover' I decided to go try it. It was a bit of a struggle finding this place but thanks to you Yelpers, I searched for the pool table & the hallway LOL.  This place is amazing. I mustve went at a good time because there were no lines. The pizza is so good. I dreamt about it last night. Definitely coming back here next time I'm in Vegas. I got a slice of pepperoni & a slice of cheese. I believe its about $5 a slice.   I wish they had a soda fountain so we could re-fill our drinks but oh well.
998	1	Server (Dave) was really nice and explained to us the portions before ordering.  We ordered the meat lover for 4 people and we had a lot of left overs with 5 people eating. Dave was honest and all the waiters/waitresses helped one another with their tables.  Great service and food.  Don't forget to leave a review for free ice cream
1272	1	Better known as "the establishment responsible for robbing me of half a day's worth of tourist time."    How, you ask? Well...  (Cue dream harp flashback sequence music.)  We started the day off with every intention of being productive. Woke up at a decent enough time (especially considering that we were on vacation mode), and headed to brunch at the Hash House.   Loved the dcor (sleek and modern), and was tickled by their slogan - "Twisted Farm Food" (farm fresh food with a 'twist').  After perusing the menu, I knew immediately that I wanted the Fried Chicken & Waffles Tower. How could I not?! I mean, a TOWER of fried goodness! I shot down my hubby's attempt to share an order, determined to take down the tower (and save the princess?) on my own.   My dish arrived, and I was in foodie heaven. Laced with crispy bacon pieces, these waffles were no ordinary Eggos. And the fried chicken. Oh. My. Goodness. Infused with sage and fried to absolute perfection -- I would have no qualms with eating THESE chicken pieces out of a red and white bucket with my bare hands! Thankfully, we were provided with silverware so this was not necessary. I used my knife and fork to tackle my fried food tower like a civilized person thankyouverymuch.  As could have been predicted, I was defeated by the tower of gluttony. Though undoubtedly delicious - I couldn't eat another bite. In hindsight, I probably should have agreed to split an order. Alas, I had once again become a victim of 'eyes bigger than tummy' syndrome.   Here's where the details get sketchy. We headed home (or did we go for Boba first?), and somehow made it to one of the bedrooms. We each felt the need to (falsely) assure one another that we were not going to fall asleep. I wanna say we put in a DVD. I wanna say my sister and I were even munching on some Swedish Fish as an attempt to further perpetrate our 'we're totally normal' act.   I wanna say we succumbed to food coma pretty instantaneously.   It must have been a pretty sad sight when my mom walked in to find all of us completely unconscious -- my sister and I laid out on the bed (with an, ahem, EMPTY Swedish Fish bag between us), and our respective men sprawled out on the floor (one of them with his belt and pants button undone to accommodate his fullness).   Oh, and I should mention - this was FIVE hours later. We had taken a FIVE HOUR midday siesta, thanks to our Hash House feast. We were forced to throw in the towel on any plans we originally had for the day, and made a pact to one another that we would not let this happen again.  (Music screeches to a halt.)  Until, that is, we met the 30-inch pizza. Alas, a story for another day...
726	1	Nothing has changed..excellent service, excellent food..very pricey but it's all worth it.  This time I had the ceasar salad, filet (medium rare), Mac and cheese, foie gras, bone marrow and the sticky toffee pudding...my plate was empty when I left and my tummy was very happy
182	0	I went to the grab and go window.  1 star for the service, 2.5 for the food.  They don't serve hot food before 11:30am, cashier was kind of rushy and impolite, and didn't let me order nachos--even though it was 11:25am.  She didn't even register all the items we wanted to order.  Food: The donut is big and Ok. The frozen hot chocolate is meh.  Not bad if there's nothing else around, but not really worth $17.  I'll probably avoid this place in the future.
883	1	Favorite Korean BBQ spot in Vegas! FYI - it's not AYCE, but it ends up coming out to ~$30/person anyway (unless you have a huge appetite) so comparable in price. Quality of meat, variety of offerings, and service are all better than what you receive at AYCE joints. Also nice, central location away from all other Spring Mtn spots. Highly recommended!
176	0	I just got back from Vegas and had a great time at Tao - nice decor, beatiful people, and fun with friends. However, (this applies only to guys)why I give it such a low rating is that their bouncers and dress code are so whacked. If you look like you're too casual, even with a button down short sleeve shirt, they'll turn you away. If you're wearing brown shoes (Steve Madden), they'll also turn you away. If you don't tuck in your shirt (guys), they'll turn you away. WTF is up with that? Our groups of guys had to go back to the room, change shoes and shirts to go back and wait in line again...I think it's just ridiculous...who goes with tucked in shirts to a night club, I'm not going there for work. Oh in addition, if you go with a bunch of guys, you won't be able to get in unless you get a table/bottle service. They only allow 1:1 ratio of girl to guy or more girls and less guys in your group before they let you in.
674	0	We stayed at the Hilton Las Vegas in the past, but DON"T confuse the LVH with the HILTON! This is no longer the HILTON!! I didn't realize this when I made my reservation on Expedia (my mistake). This place is smoky and run down. The first room we were given had broken curtains that would not close. I called the front desk and we were sent to another room several floors down from where we were. This room was clean, but the ceiling had a huge water stain. The carpet also had stains. We kept the Do Not Disturb sign in our door. We didn't trust anyone going in our room. The safe was $13 a day to use!!! What??? That's ridiculous!! We went to the diner cafe place and it is way overpriced!!!! My husband and I split a $11 bacon and cheese omelet...blah! What happened to the cheap Vegas prices?? Not at this place! We also tried the Vince Neil restaurant (see review..NOT recommended!)  Most of the staff working this hotel and casino had no personality or seemed rude!! I ordered a drink at the bar and I was playing video poker. I noticed a bill in front of me, so I asked the bartender if my drink was comped for playing. He picked up the bill and said, "don't you see? what does this say?" RUDE!! The only reason I am giving this place a 2 star is for my winnings of $600, but we do not recommend staying here!
780	1	I got offered over an hour wait at a restaurant upstairs, heard this spot was a nice place to grab a quick meal, but still has a 30+ minute wait. I wanted to at least get some cosmo experience, so I ponied up to the bar here. Despite the business, A Daisy Dukes put on a good show when it came to pouring my drinks and helping me with the menu. The 'BFG' as she put it=DANK. Lamb burgers are definitely my new flavor.
379	1	Can Lotus of Siam be summed up? Can it be leveled by a few words? You'd be hard pressed. Try criticizing the best Thai meal of your life, one that you paid less for than almost every Thai dinner you've ever had.   Completely unpretentious, despite an incredible Riesling selection and the most robust and spicy Thai flavors you'll ever come across. Make sure to order Yam Nua, the grilled steak salad with mint and chili.  I am still speechless after my meal, the flavors lingering on my tongue and beckoning me to move to Las Vegas so I can eat here more often. Well, no meal can drive you that far.
1206	0	My daughter had to come here during our recent visit to LAS to try their famous frozen hot chocolate! Not impressed.  Service extremely slow. Waitress delivered one item at a time.  With the exception of a hot dog my sister in law ordered, we all ordered ice cream.  We got our sundae 2nd and we were actually finished when the next order which was my daughter's frozen hot chocolate.  We were all done eating our ice cream and then came the hot dog.  We waited another ten -fifteen mins after she finished eating the hot dog to get her frozen hot chocolate.  They obviously need more staff.  With the high prices they can afford it! Won't be going back if I can help it! BTW, clean the tables before you seat someone!
375	1	The ox tail fries were as good as I hoped. The portion is plenty to share, too. My husband ordered the Sho Gun Burger and I ordered a bowl of ramen (which is actually next door at Shoku Ramen). I love that you can order ramen while you're sitting at burger place. I also ordered the bone marrow as an appetizer. It was my first time having it anywhere so I wasn't sure what to expect. It was a little sweet. I don't think I'd care to order it again but it wasn't terrible. We went on a Saturday around 4:30-5:00 and we waited probably 20 minutes for a table. It got busier once we were seated. I do wish their waiting area was a little bigger.
1602	1	Great place! It's still decorated in that "old Vegas" style with neon and mirrors everywhere. Very cool looking place! The food is outstanding and they serve a full menu 24 hours a day. The portions are large and very filling. It's a decent value considering how much food you get here. I would definitely recommend not missing out on The Peppermill whenever you are in town!
1593	1	This was my first time at Bachi Burger and I will definitely be back. I work in the evenings and by the time I'm off, most places are closed so I'm extremely happy to have found another late night place I can enjoy dinner at.  The Miyagi San burger was amazing. Hands down the best burger I've ever had. We also ordered a side of fries with the pineapple ketchup which were good as well. The portions were great and filling.  On top of that the service and management were wonderful.  Can't wait for my next experience here.
919	1	As I drunkly stumbled upon this place, there was no doubt that my nose had led me to this delicious pizza heaven. JK. But yes I was drunk, but a friend took us here. How could I call Vegas my backyard, if I barely just tried Secret Pizza!!  From what I remembered, the line was quite long, wrapped around the corner, but it was good for me to sober up. The interior decoration was fun, a couple machines for people to kill time with while inhaling that greasy yet mouth watering smell of fresh pizza. As I walked closer to order, my eyes widened and spotted the server tossed a freshly made Mushroom pizza in the bottom pizza drawer, I yelled (I think I yelled), I want that! Oh yes, it was filled with lots of fresh mushrooms and great crust. Wish I had ordered more, but man, it was pricy, but you do get what you paid for.   I am coming back again, hopefully more sober so I can actually take a decent picture and enjoy the pizza.
1053	1	Exquisite and just a phenomenal place to eat and dine out with that special someone. The experience was fantastic. The food, drinks, appetizers and the presentation were one of the best I have had on a long time. Located in the heart of the Venetian casino, we have a VIP experience all the way. The salad was perfectly dressed and seasoned. The stake and the seafood which were our main course for meal were prepared better than imagined. A little pricy but worth every penny.
1601	0	Tried to charge us additional than what they first told us at check in.  "Happy Hour" from 5-6 always ran out of food and drinks by 5:15. Very poor planning. We had to request our room be serviced because we were skipped for 2 days. The Starbucks overcharged my card and when I confronted them they said it was my issue to handle.  Had to request towels be sent to our room, when they didn't bring them had to request again. No follow up from staff and was treated like I was an inconvenience.    On the good side the room was neat and what I expected and the roof top pool was relaxing.
87	0	Ok. When you go to Las Vegas to get the hell away and have to pay for airfare as well. All I can tell you is it's old, worn, but CLEAN! I did feel as if I was stuck in circa 1978 for a few days but hey! It actually worked for the money. It's not fancy and far away from the new part of the strip so I suggest instead of paying for monorail tickets bring or rent a car!
171	1	Went here for lunch on New Year's Day and it was amazing! The guys who work at the counter were so friendly and provided exceptional service! For our friend he was given a small slice (which really wasn't that small), but the guy at the counter threw in a free extra slice without us even a asking! Wow! Not only that, but the guy also made sure to give me a perfect slice! Seriously, the pizza was delicious, but what really won us over was how friendly and awesome the crew are! They also found out it was my boyfriends birthday and they made sure to all wish him well and gave him a yummy dessert on the house! We will definitely be sure to make secret pizza a vegas tradition from now on!! Wonderful experience!!!
1352	0	Stayed here for a convention.  It was about $130/nt.  Could have gotten a nicer room on the strip for less, and caught a car or the monorail.  Some of the rooms have been remodeled, some haven't.  There's no difference in rate.   Then there's the joy of being nickled and dimed for everything.  Internet (for a hotel that caters to conventioneers, who are there for work usually) cost like $15/day.  Gym facilities? $20/day.  I get it.  People are there for work, work is paying, who cares if you add another surcharge?  I care.  I will not stay here again - too many better options abound.  I was excited to stay in a Hilton hotel.  It didn't live up to the brand.
1870	1	Because we saw Anthony Bourdain eat at Bouchon on "No Reservations" and rave about the food, we put Bouchon on our list of restaurants to visit. And we didn't eat there just once -- because brunch at Bouchon was so tasty on our first day in Vegas, we left Vegas on a high note and visited Bouchon again for brunch on our last day!   The restaurant has a cute, vintage bistro atmosphere with eye-catching tilework. The staff is great at seating guests near the windows by the courtyard during breakfast and brunch. And the homemade butter is so fantastic that you might just eat the butter by itself.   So during our two visits, we ate: -Croque Madame: it's like taking the most perfect eggs benedict you can imagine, replacing the types of bread, and then making the dish even more delectable and delicious.  -Brioche french toast: incredible! The toast pieces had no sogginess or heaviness; instead, the toast was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside.  -Omelette with salad: tasty and fluffy omelette with a fantastic mixed greens salad. The vinaigrette was flavorful yet light and was great for breakfast/brunch. -Pastries: this place knows what it's doing with pastries! We ate a chocolate croissant and pecan sticky bun at the restaurant and also enjoyed a macaron from the Bouchon Bakery stand in the Venetian on the main floor. Don't go anywhere else and order a pastry; get your pastry at Bouchon!  Put Bouchon on your list for Vegas breakfast/brunch places. If it's morning and you're hungry, go to Bouchon, and you will not be disappointed.
38	0	I purchased a Groupon for my Vegas trip.  The reviews were mainly average or bad so I took a chance.  What an idiot I am!!  There was a wait which was fine.  I gave my name and number to the semi-nice host for a text message when table will be ready.  She said 15 mins.  I decided to go gamble.  The machine was paying too, however I realized it was well over 15 mins and went back to host.  She said she tried texting me 3 times and showed her logs, which is odd.  I received other text messages and FB messages but not hers. She placed me back on "the list."  About 5 mins later another hostess sat me and hub, she was not friendly.  The decor was nice, semi-clean.  The server was all over the place.  We had to hunt for her a couple of times.  She tried to be friendly but she appeared that she was overworked and just started that day.  The food was not good.  I would have done better looking for a Taco Bell.  Trust me....forget this place, so not worth your time and money.
1034	1	I can't say enough good things about this place. Gordon Ramsey has really nailed it here. Every time I come to Vegas (and lately it's been fairly often) I need to stop by here.  Their burgers are spot on. Well constructed, great selection of flavors. They don't overdo it with the toppings. Even though there are several burger options to choose from, they change up the toppings just enough to give unique burger experiences, but still let the flavor of the beef shine. My favorites so far are the farm burger and the Brittania burger, you can't go wrong with either. Only downside is that the burgers are $15+. Whatever, worth it.  Where BurGR really shines though, is in the sides and shakes. Their truffle fries are the best fries I've ever had and their jalapeo poppers are out of this world. The Oreo milkshake is unlike anything I've ever seen before. Oreo milkshake, creme brle, whipped cream, and an Oreo cookie in top. Jesus take the wheel.
833	1	Going into my dinner here at Shake Shack, I never thought anything would come close to my love for In N' Out Burger. Much to my surprise, Shake Shack came close and even surpassed In N' Out in several ways!  Service: Sorry, but In N' Out wins for service. When we arrived at Shake Shack there was a very long line, which wasn't a problem because it gave us time to discuss the menu (prominently displayed on a large wall right when you walk in). The line moved fast and soon enough it was our turn; however, the woman who took our order was ornery and short with us. B-  Decor: I LOVED the ambience and decor in Shake Shack. We snagged a spot on the large bar table in the center of the restaurant (shared by up to fifteen diners) and had a great view over the open kitchen and large flat screen TVs. I noticed couches, tables, and benches all throughout Shake Shack. A+  Food: We waited about 8-10 minutes for our food (as expected, given the large amount of people). It was well worth the wait! The burger patties were absolutely DIVINE. If you are looking for fresh and juicy, order the Shack Burger. I can't say enough good things about the patties. The only problem I had was that I asked for a lettuce-wrapped burger, and instead I got a patty on top of a slice of lettuce (making for quite a messy meal). In N' Out wins for food presentation and sauce but as much as it pains me to say it, Shake Shack has the better patty. A+  For three burgers (with added bacon), a side of fries, and a mango lemonade, it came to about $25.   Shake Shack definitely deserves the five stars.
1021	1	If you find yourself wandering on the 3rd floor trying to determine if you dressed appropriately swing back down to this joint. The price is decent and the food will surprise you (hopefully for the better). I had the brisket burger while visiting in Vegas and it made me forget about In and Out for at least a few hours. Honestly this place gets pretty creative with their burgers which I commend them for and the fries are awesome. I didn't get a shake because the beer selection was so good. I did get a pretty decent grumbly stomach after eating here but in all fairness I had been eating all sorts of junk including fried pickles and the Swedish fish candy from NY,NY hotel. I would visit again next time I'm in Vegas.
880	0	I did love the room. However I'm on a NON Smoking floor but have complained daily due to chain smoking and weed. They will do nothing About it. They said I have to know who it is. Are you kidding me. Come up here and see for yourself! I have a headache from all the smoke!
926	1	Came here to eat some Korean food and I was just blown away by how good it was. We ordered many different types of meat and all of them were very tender and good. This place uses real good quality meat.   Another awesome thing about this place is the service. The staff here are A+++++ when it comes to service. Jin was awesome in giving us the best service possible.   I am definitely coming here everytime i come to vegas.
1056	1	I'll preface this review with the fact that I am NOT a breakfast person. I don't love anything about it. Except when I visit the Egg & I. And let me tell you ... it became a weekly event after a while.  I can't turn down fresh squeezed OJ. This restaurant has delicious OJ. You should try it at least once. I love their menu. They have interesting combinations, like chicken, pesto, and eggs, and delicious twists on common breakfast dishes, like French toast. I love the scrambles the most, and would  often get the veggie scramble sitting atop ranch potatoes. Slather that mound with hot sauce and call it a day. Expect an exhilerating food coma to follow. The portions are big. I also recommend trying their complimentary banana nut muffin at least once. I don't like muffins or bananas, seriously, but I like theirs. Be adventurous, don't order eggs and a side of bacon. Live it up a little...  Super awesome service. Expect to wait on the weekends for breakfast/brunch, but they have a quick turn-around and great waiters/waitresses. A nice perk to the crowded atmosphere is an egg on the table that you can flip when you require service. On a very busy day it's very helpful to the staff, and don't be afraid to use it! I've always had friendly, impeccable service here ... no complaints. I've brought every out-of-town guest here for breakfast, and we've always left happy. Stop in and give it a try!
435	1	MAN did I love this place! I really love how creative they are with their presentation. The Fried Chicken Benedict was almost doing too much, but it was worth it! The corned beef hash was great. I have no complaints at all about that. The blueberry pecan flapjack was amazing. We were all talking about the pecans. Then later on that night I snuck away to try one of the scrambles. Another hit!! Everything was amazing!
1360	0	I'd like to give it -2 stars. My husband and I were unfortunately awarded 2 free dinners for a Hilton time share tour and we chose this out of three options because we had never tried a Churrascaria. We have friends that have been to Fogo De Choa and although it was pricey, they raved about it. I've eaten with them many times and know their taste. This was not it! Almost all of the meats were overcooked and extremely bland. The salad bar was eh. The staff was completely unengaging. Though we had free tickets, we actually opted to pay an additional $20 a piece so as not to be limited to one meat. It was a complete disappointment. We followed this with another deeply disappointing show with Marc Savard. Just so you don't think we just complain a lot, we immensely enjoyed our meals at Oyster Bay Seafood and Wine Bar and Fix at the Bellagio! And..........Absinthe, is a must SEE!!
1508	0	If you want deal with a staff who is super hospitable and accommodating but want a room that smells of sweat, weed, and sadness then this is perfect. Our room was "non-smoking" but someone made a filter out of a plastic bag and put it over the smoke detector so they could hot box it. I loved the view outside the hotel but at night the holes in the curtains from critters let the Vegas strip bright lights through to make your room a customized planetarium. Our tub was brown and it would clog every time you would shower. The room decor looked like they found a LOWES going out of business and took all the 2x4 boards and lined the ceiling and made outdated headboards which are great for slamming hookers against. Our safe didn't work but got fixed. I also while taking a nap found a piece of glass in my sheets. I'm praying it's a broken piece of a cocktail glass and not a crack pipe. The water filter behind the ice machine looked like it was last changed when the Dallas Cowboys won a super bowl. The carpets smelled like sweat and were moldy. The restaurant was the best part. Food was hooters food and was done well for what they do. The bar staff was really nice. Overall the hotel was super sketch. If you want to go for an experience and a good story then it's a 10/10. Otherwise pick somewhere else. It always could be worse. I want to reiterate the staff was awesome and a pleasure to deal with.
421	0	Good god this place is disgusting. It smells like old cigarettes and looks like an old cigarette. You know those Dateline specials where they take a black light and expose things like poo and sperm all over the bed? This is totally one of those places. I even had a dream one night that I got pink eye. So why give it two stars? I got to give it some credit for sucking as hard as it does.
585	1	This is the best burger joint in Vegas. Had the hell's fire burger, sweet potato fries, wings for appetizer and a chocolate shake. Everything tasted fresh. Burger was great size and cooked to perfection. Sweet potato fries were so good and were sprinkled with powdered sugar. Wings were amazing. Service was awesome.  Will definitely come back.
1911	0	Stayed at this hotel because of a Groupon deal. The hotel is extremely outdated. It has a very dingy dirty feeling. The bathtub felt slimy when you stepped in it. The carpets and toilet were dirty as well. The AC worked well but parts were just hanging off. The glass was cracked on the closet door and the T.V. is a dinosaur. The pool is no longer open 24 hours either. The gambling area is so small and needs a major make-over. There are only 2 restaurants in this hotel. The positives are the staff was very friendly, Hooters Restaurant is open 24/7 and for the price it was very close to the strip. Overall, the negatives out way the positives and I would never stay at this hotel again. It felt worse than Motel 6.
1138	1	Ugh this place is so good. I'm somewhat glad this place is 4+ hours away since I would just get fat going here.  Service Super attentive ! Water was always filled and I didn't have to raise my hand for too long if I needed something. Bae and I came here without a reservation on a Saturday (they only serve dinner at 5:30pm on weekends) and sat in a line for maybe 8min at most.  Food - garlic prawns.  What is there to say ? Incredibly flavorful, buttery and garlicky and I don't even know what else I'm eating but I just know my tongue is super happy. Bae and I got maybe 8 prawns and we still had leftovers - boat noodle soup (combination beef noodle soup/#109) Holy this is prolly my fav thing here other than the prawns. So incredibly flavorful and it almost makes me cry from whatever flavors my tongue is experiencing. Kicks my hometown Thai place's boat noodle soup out of the water. Honestly this doesn't even need the vermicelli noodles. If you get this with the beef and the bean sprouts, in combination with the amazing broth, you won't even miss the noodles. Get this. - khao soi Egg noodles in a light curry sauce with beef topped with crispy egg noodles. This was a tad hair shorter in the flavor department compared to the boat noodle soup, but with a squeeze of lime, it elevated the flavor tenfold. Pretty good, kind of a small portion. - nam kao tod (crispy fried rice) If you're looking for a flavor explosion with a bit of a crunch, I'd recommend this. Filled with crispy rice (how do they do it...), peanuts, a healthy dose of lime, sour pork sausage, red onions, I'm sure fish sauce, peanuts and other stuff, this is a party in your mouth. Compared to Vientiane (garden grove), this place stands it's ground for crispy rice. Bae kept looking up and pondering how this made his tastebuds flip. - mango sticky rice I love sticky rice and bae has never had mango sticky rice, so this was perfect. The rice seemed a little hard (chewier) than other ones I had, but it also had a fragrant jasmine taste to it. The mangoes were the small ones and it was an ample amount. Sweet and yummy, bae ate the whole thing.
1666	0	Wooooow! Where do I begin?  My cousins and I were looking for a great spot to grab a drink before heading to the airport to go home. We head to the bar and the most unfriendliest steroid filled bartender comes over to us and doesn't even greet us. He just stands there until I actually speak first and request a Michelada. He doesn't even acknowledge my 2 cousins and he walks away to another bar to bring me a beer in one cup and a salt rimmed cup with bloody Mary mix in a separate cup.... "the salt gets crazy that's why I didn't put the beer in it".... what the whaaaaaaat? I ask for a michelada and you bring me a build a bear workshop? Get outta here. I can go on but I'm so annoyed at his service. We left right away. Never going back. Only giving it 1 star because I have to. If you're having a bad day, call in sick.  Don't bring your attitude to the bar. Jerk.
1462	0	On the positive side, this place has a great view, so if you're coming here, I recommend getting a seat overlooking the fountains and ordering beer and some shots.  The food is not good... we had an overly greasy torta and some very bad basic mexican dishes.
426	0	Don't bother! We were greeted by some blonde hostess girl who was being EXTRA rude to everyone who had a question....we asked how long the wait was and they said  it was a 30 to 40 mins but we were on our way out of Vegas so we went to the To Go side....... All 4 of us ordered the bacon cheeseburger which was literally the size of a McDonald's hamburger it came with cheese and bacon no condiments not lettuce or tomatoes with fries an extra large soda for $16 each!!! We could have gone to In n out and spent that much on 2 meals I wanted rootbeer as my drink so They had to give me a small because the rootbeer is more expensive?????.  The banana split my friend ordered was not spectacular I could have made a better one at home plus it wouldn't cost nearly as much.
1310	1	Here's another one of my Vegas favorites. A great place for a first date or taking friends from out of town. The ambiance here is simply one of a kind.   More neon, mirrors, and red velvet than you can shake a stick at! Oh and the video screens everywhere with cool 80's videos, those are great.   If you can, get a seat next to the water feature with flames ripping out of it, it's a little warm but pretty cool.   I've never actually eaten in the restaurant but the food in the lounge is pretty tasty. The selection is standard bar fare.   The cocktails are not the cheapest in town but they're pretty good, and delivered by sexy ladies. The super sized scorpion is good for a group.   Some of my best nights have ended here. Skip the other late night eateries and head straight for the Peppermill!
1236	1	The Toro beef was amazing. It was so good! The waiter was very nice. My friend got the ramen noodles and it looked really good. I would highly recommend the lunch special for someone looking for food in vegas. Side dishes are amazing! Washrooms are nice.
1227	1	All I need to say is Beef Wellington and Sticky Toffee Pudding! WOW!  Both are signature Gordon Ramsey dishes and now I know why. The Beef Wellington is extremely tender!  Unfortunately, it was my husband's dish so I only got a couple of bites.  I got the 24 oz. ribeye and while it was good, the Beef Wellington was a lot better.  We, as a group of 6, was so FULL, we shared just one toffee pudding. Next time, I'm getting my own no matter how full I mean. Deliciousness.
1931	0	We had decided to eat dinner there last night and we were promptly seated, even though our reservation wasn't for another 30 min. Everything was looking great and smelling great... But then after we were seated in the private dinning area in the wine racks, it was like we were forgotton. The waiter came and took our drink orders and my parents bottle of wine. He returned almost 10 minutes later with water glasses and left. We didn't receive our water until we finally were able to grab someone passing by the door to ask for our water. That was over 20 minutes. And finally the water came. It took nearly 30-35minutes. The wine came and the waters too. We were so thirsty from a long day in the sun. The waiter took out order, and returned to check on us once after that. It took nearly another 40 min to recieve the food we had ordered. My father and little brother ordered the meat rodizuo. The all you can meats brought to you on a sword. Well they waited and waiter after three of use recieved our plates but only 2 of the servers came by and served them just chicken. It wasnt till the three out of five were almost done with our food that, I had to ask the manager for service for the meat ridizuo orders. So we had to sit and wait for them to get served and to eat.   The service was bad and so was the timing. You would think that paying 300 for dinner, that the service would be better. What an awefule experince to have when you hungry and hoping for the service that is expected in any restaurant. We would have been better served at dennys.
1012	0	I am not sure if it is the fact that this Lee's Sandwich is located in Las Vegas, that the owners feel compelled to follow the lead of other well-known and loved California-based eateries (i.e., Pinks Hotdog, Sam Woos) that set up shop here, by jacking up the price and cutting back on what it serves.  At least that is what I think after visiting Lee's post their officially grand opening.  Sandwiches still taste the same, except you just get less of everything that goes in between the fresh baked baguette (meat, pickled radish and carrots and even cilantro and slices of chilie).  Iced coffee still tastes great, except you get more ice than coffee.  Even if you ask for less ice, you will get less ice but also a cup that is not full (imagine an inch of nothing to top of your plastic cup).  Anyway, the place is new and very nice looking.  Staff is still trying to master the sandwich menu, so I am sure eventually they will get faster with fulfilling the orders.  But unless they start to serve what we can get normally at all the other Lee's sandiwch shops up and down California, potential customers are better off patronizing other local banh mi shops.  And there are quite a few of them just a few blocks down Spring Mountain Rd.  I wish I can like this Lee's Sandwich more, but after a few visits I am too disappointed to want to go back.  As it stands, I feel that this Lee's is trying to set the bar extremely low for what customers should expect from this location, perhaps not realizing that a vast majority of the patrons have had the Lee's experience from California prior to visiting this one.  I can only guess that as a new food service operator in Las Vegas, they failed to do any sort of market or demographic analysis and/or extremely ignorant of the commonsense knowledge that roughly 50% of the visitors that come to LV are visiting from CA (land of the Lee's Sandwiches).  So we will see how well they fare after the novelty wears out, because without a course correction I see only iceberg ahead for this Titanic of a Lee's Sandwich.  (UPDATE) - From David Y: A worker told him to ask for "less ice and more coffee" when ordering their Lee's Iced Coffee, otherwise the future lawyers fulfilling the orders behind the counter will do exactly as the customer requested. How knew ordering a effing cup of the common Vietnamese Iced Coffee is the stepping stone to studying for the LSAT.
980	0	Came here with some friends and my husband for brunch and we were disappointed. The only thing I enjoyed was my corned beef hash. Our waitress was cold and short with us, the food was just ok and the prices were way too high! I realize these are fairly large portions but the quality of the food was lacking thus didn't deserve to be this expensive. My friends wanted to go here because they ate here 4 yrs ago and loved it. They were disappointed as well.
781	0	The place was so unorganized, and to be 'politically correct'....It's GHETTO! The employees, the food, the clientele...GHETTO! We were afraid just the parking lot alone, why they do not hire security! But, if you love your fried ochra, fried chicken, corn bread and ice tea....this might be "your joint"!....just don't for get to wear the bullet proof vest!.....
1476	0	You know that one all-you-can-eat dining hall on your undergraduate college campus? That's where I felt like I was when I stepped foot into the spice market.  I spent most of my time chowing down on the crab legs to get the best bang for my buck, and succeeded with crushing atleast 3 full plates of them, but  I also tried to stuff myself with some of the other buffet offerings. The crab legs themselves were pretty good, but I've had better. Nothing else I tried was really all that great. The baked desserts were dry, the soups were overly salty, and the other foods did not taste very fresh.  Priced at $35/pp my first Vegas buffet experience was pretty disappointing, and I was expecting so much more... but no worries, it's definitely not my last. At least they had a mexican bar where I could make my own guac and chips? Guac is my kryptonite.
922	1	I absolutely LOVE this place! I wish i made billions of dollars when I went to Vegas so I could pig out here all day everyday!  First off the service is wonderful! Everyone was so friendly and all smiles! They are also very helpful in explaining the menu and pointing out favorites.   Bread: so delicious! If only I had 10 stomachs, I would have kept asking for more! It was soft and warm and there was a whole bunch of different ones. And that butter!! It was so creamy, I almost wanted to put the whole butter one only one slice of bread, but I had to share :p  Kurobuta Pork Belly: delicious!  The meat was very juicy. The cheesy grits was awesome and it went really well together.  Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras: it was my first time trying foie gras and I fell in love(Please don't send me hate mail animal lovers, i really didn't mean for it to be this way). The herbed goat cheese pop overs weren't for me, but if you like goat cheese you would love this.   Mac and cheese: very creamy. I usually don't like blue cheese in anything, but it was really good. Couldn't eat too much of it because it was filling.  Demi bone marrow: please order with your steak you wouldn't regret!  American eye wrapped with Mangalista pork: most juiciest and greatest piece of steak I have ever had. I also had a piece of seared foie gras to go with it! The foie and the steak goes so well together. When I eat the foie with the steak, it was like eating a piece of butter with steak and you know butter is life! Haha I feel like all the other steaks I've ever had in my life was a joke!   Overall, this place had made me one snobby steak eater. Steak back at home just ain't the same.
302	1	THE HYPE WAS REALLY REALLY HIGH when 15 of my friends came here.  Being CA natives, nothing has ever topped in n out. We got all sorts of burgers, fries, shakes, and beers.   In summary: it definitely lived up to the hype. This is going to be a very very successful chain of they keep it up!! Can't believe I am saying this, but I'd rather go here than In n Out .
1008	1	Everyone is sooooo nice here. The customer service is great and of course the food is amazing. Not only will I be coming back as much as possible I will recommend it to my friends. I'm not a huge beef person but I got the lonely bird which was recommended to me and it is more than delicious. Milkshake infused alcohol is amazing as well. Everything is just so perfect about this place.
1402	0	Riviera is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in my life. I've traveled around US and Europe and stayed at hotels of different range, but this one stands out the most, sadly for it, in a bad way.   I got a deal on Groupon, and we paid $54 per studio room/day which wasn't a quite usual studio. It was just a room with an empty fridge, non functional TV and toilet, bed bugs, loud conditioner, dirty linens, the most horrible service and most importantly ROBBERY. And i was charged $34 upon my check out (taxes+resort fee per 2 days).  So we checked in at 5 pm and went down to the strip by Monorail, which was quite expensive and within 15 min walk from the hotel.  We got back to the hotel around midnight and found my husband's backpack and my purse stolen from the room. First I couldn't believe it, the reality was too hard to believe. Besides my husband's birthday just started minutes ago after we found his stuff stolen along with his passport. We called the security right away. It took them a while before they finally came to the room and gave us the report sheets. They seemed pretty helpful although they said they are just the third party and hotel risk management will contact us in 5-7 business days from the day of our report. It's been over a month and no one has contacted us, so I decided to do it myself. The risk management "doesn't discuss camera information" and all they said no one has entered our room, according to entry key system. I've got no words to express my disappointment. Do yourself a huge favor and NEVER EVER STAY at this hotel !!!
383	1	Very nice settings and workers there. The food was awesome my wife had  a Beeny that was very delicious the eggs were poached perfectly. I had a skillet that was absolutely fantastic. The coffee was spot on not to strong or weak. Definitely going to go back it not prices high either, which i throughly thought was going to be more expensive. Very happy to spend my morning eating there. GREAT JOB!!!
812	1	Move. the. hell. over, Earl of Sandwich. I found a new late-night lover and it's NY style pizza in Vegas.   My girlfriend raved about this place, while I rolled my eyes and insisted we go to Earl instead. She convinced me and we walked on over after a long night at the Marquee (both conveniently located in the Cosmo) and we were all speechless after our first bite.   We ordered a combo of white cheese, sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms. I've never been a HUGE fan of pizza, but this thin, wide slice was simple and flawless.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iCQpiavjjPzJ5_3gPD5Ebg?select=3cIZSbjXqJxr59N_84xHKQ  Do you remember when Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael (TMNT) ended their adventure by tearing down a slice of ooey gooey cheese pizza?   WE FELT EXACTLY LIKE THAT (or at least I did).
1098	0	I only ate here because it came free with our room (and with unlimited drinks at the west wing bar...woohoo!)   I agree with lots of others here, its not the best but not the worst either...but definitely not worth the money they ask for.  If you get this place comped or free, then COOL! You can never go wrong with omelets and bacon for breakfast or mashed potatoes and fried chicken and salads for dinner.  Don't expect much from this buffet and don't pay full price either. Studio B buffet is half the cost and WAY better.   Pros: -Convenient if you're staying at the hotel and can get comped for it, you'll be seated quicker -Has solid buffet basics:fresh green salads and veggies, potatoes and chicken...if you don't go fancy you'll be okay.  Cons: -The "fancier" items looked really suspect to me.  -Super busy and kinda nuts in there. Didn't really like the traffic in and around this buffet.
93	1	My southern grandma passed away without sharing some of her famous recipies with the family.  This place has food that tastes just like and similar to grandma's!  The tastes of the warm biscuit (with fruit topping) and rich mashed potatos really took me back to my childhood.  The portions are HUGE, you'll probably need a to go box.  Cost is low considering the value.  The bill for two people with a 25% tip was $53.    I thought it was interesting that they don't have heat lamps, so food gets delivered to your table as it's ready.  REALLY that's how it should be, everyone gets their food as fresh as possible.  The presentation of the food is very thoughtful and the taste is rich (heavy, southern style).  Don't expect to eat for the rest of the day, you'll likely be too full! :-)  I had a mint latte here that was one of the best I have ever tasted (and I've had tons of lattes)!    Our waitress "Kai," (short hair, enthusiastic) was super nice and helpful.  We saw her stand on top of a chair to take a picture of a large party at a table- that's service!  We'll be back and likely ask to be seated in her section. :-)
1257	1	Once again, Bachi burger does not disappoint! Today we had the sweet potato fries to start, then the chef's special: Spicy Miso Burger and the Lonely Bird burger.   I almost want to retract my previous review of the Ronin being the Death Row burger. The spicy miso burger is definitely a knife-and-forker. The lonely bird was a picker-upper and held it's own. I swear everytime I come here and think that I had already tried the best burger, something new proves me wrong. Never a dull moment in the food adventure at Bachi Burger. Thanks to Melissa our server today for the recommendation! You guys are awesome!
737	1	Shack Stack cheeseburger is much better than In N Out. The crisp-fried Portobello mushroom filled with melted cheese was so yummy! Cheese Fries is OK, and Coffee Shade is too sweet for me. And the prices are are much higher than In N Out. I will come back again.
209	0	This Westin has slipped. We always stay there for Furniture Market because the parking is free and very abundant. It also has the Heavenly beds which I love and a Starbucks in the lobby. Yeah! But something has changed and service has slipped. I'm not sure we will stay there again despite the fact that we are Starwood preferred members.   My room had very spotty air conditioning which was important since it was 107 degrees. So I called down to get someone to come fix it...yada yada yada...he comes...says he's fixed it. Temp doesn't change. Finally fall asleep exhausted from the day...hot and sweaty in the not-so-heavenly bed. Then the next day their solution is to move me....I don't want to move all my unpacked stuff to another floor from my colleagues one day away from leaving. She sends guy again. This time he discovers that he's left a critical part off the air co causing the air not to flow. Then it works wonderfully. Other issues...floor not swept or vaccuumed any day we were there. Trash left out in room....not "subject to interpretation" trash but things like crumpled paper and little creamer carton from the very very weak starbucks in room coffee.   Anyways....nothing was tragic...life is too short to get too worked up...but it does seem that there has been a dramatic shift since in the past it has been such a nice experience.
1935	1	We walked up and the line was huge! Waited for 20 minutes and it was so worth it. Their Sicilian slices are $8 but they are as big as your head and delicious! Their regular slices are $5 and not as big but still the best slice you'll get in Vegas! We come back every time!
564	0	Gross! I ordered grapefruit bowl and side of yogurt. My strawberries were rotten and disgusting looking. My uncle's steak potato plate had a dark curly long hair in it. Probably a woman's hair, and our server was male so the kitchen must be dirtay! Server seemed annoyed, not good hospitality. Customer is always right. We didn't complain there b/c family isnt like that
1423	1	Oh. My. Goodness. This place has some great pizza! It really is a secret, because the location has no sign. The crowds of people walking into the narrow hallway are what give it away. Definitely a must when you visit Vegas and get a late night craving. The service is fast and the guy who cuts the slices for you is super friendly. There are several varieties of pizza to choose from so be prepared to make a decision when you get to the counter. There are a few countertops and stools to sit at but it's a very small place so be ready to take your slice and eat it while you walk around or find another place to sit. I will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas.
15	1	Since it's opening, it has become a must-do whenever we are in Vegas. Have tried 3 different burgers, all were amazing. Love the curry and chipotle katsups that come with the thick cut fries. Tried a shake for the first time on our last visit. It tasted delicious, but the pudding on top was an unexpected surprise. Expect a long wait at regular meal times. I always grab a pen at the end-- one more touch I love (twice our waitress brought more pens for us)
1341	0	I finally visited Senor Frog's after spending my whole life seeing it as THE place to visit in Cancun while on Spring Break.  I expected to pay a premium on food because of the location on the strip so I hoped the food would deliver.  I ordered a BBQ chicken wrap after the server said they are huge.  What I got was not huge, but I figured whatever, this is no Hash House A Go Go! :)  I don't know if the wrap was supposed to be warm or cold, because different parts were warm (like the chicken), but the lettuce and sauce was ice cold.  Also as I got to both ends of my half-cut wrap, the end was just a ton of sauce with no chicken, not really the best way to end the meal.  On the other hand the fries and chips and salsa were really good, so that was a plus. (I believe we had to pay for the chips though)  I don't have much of a reason to come back here, I can get a bigger and better sandwich somewhere else for half the price.  I'm sure you can do worse, but you can do a lot better on the strip for the same price point.
992	1	We absolutely ADORED this place! Everything was delicious. There was no wait & our server was on top of her game. We had a party of 5 & enjoyed corned beef hash, tostada bowl, omelettes, French toast & a few carafes of coffee. Their muffins are hot, moist and delicious & their salsa is amazing! I'm not sure what they do their potatoes, but best we ever had! Such a gem! We will be back as soon as we touch down in Vegas again.
960	1	Best burgur of my life.  I was so excited to eat here and it lived up to every expectation.  I'm so happy I was able to go here on my trip.  The quality of everything was so good.  The sweet potato fries and truffle oil fries are a must.  Hells kitchen burger was so good roasted tomatoes and jalapeos and avocado.  So good!  It's definitely a must if in Vegas.
339	1	First time eating Korean BBQ in Vegas and this place was conveniently located right across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel.  I ordered the Spicy Ramen with Egg which was especially flavorful with just the right amount of spicy.  The wife ordered the Bibimbap original which was a little on the bland side but nothing a little salt and hot sauce can't fix.  The kids enjoyed grilling the bulgogi beef and it came out sweet and tasty.  Overall just really good food and the servers were quick.  Would definitely recommend.
173	1	Such an expensive burger, but if you're offering an east coast exclusive restaurant on the west coast, expect people to line up. My friends and I got here right before peak dinner hour so the line was negligible.   I got the SmokeShack, it was pretty good, idk if I liked the chili peppers? I really liked the bread and how flavorful the patty was. The cheese fries were alright, kinda felt like it tasted like fake cheese (like they put on nachos) but tasted less like "fake" cheese.  The restaurant was really clean and well-ventilated! I like the ketchup and mustard dispensers, you don't have to pump it. It's more like a ketchup and mustard faucet. Lol
1460	1	Delicious food, the reviews are no lie! Came here for brunch while passing through Vegas on a cross-country road trip. Tried the:  1) Crazy Chicken Omelette: very good! The chicken was tender, there was a good ratio of guacamole and mushrooms, and the omelette was smothered in cheese and sour cream. Ranch potatoes on the side were fantastic, as expected. 2) Sausage gravy + sausage patty: a little on the salty side, but I thought it had a good balance of chunkiness and creaminess. I'm a bit of a sausage gravy aficionado (haha) though, so it may be that my standards are oddly high. 3) Banana Nut Muffin: needs it's own category, even if it's a side! Delicious delicious. Moist and warm, not too sweet.  I would come back! The service was great too. Even though we came right at brunch time and the place was packed, there was only a 5 min wait for two.
1900	1	This dinner was a great experience all around.  Our server, Dennis, was top notch and made great recommendations.  Be ready to spend some money (especially if you get a featured app and wine) but the beef wellington for 2 for $100 was well worth it.  It actually brought tears to my eyes it was so unbelievably good!  We had the small seafood tower for an app, split the wellington and truffle mac & cheese and toffee pudding for dessert.  This restaurant is one of the main reasons I will go back to Vegas.
1636	1	The best burgers in Las Vegas!   I lived in las vegas for three years before coming to burger bar and I wish I would have tried it much earlier. You are able to make your burger any way you want it, there are over 40 different toppings to choose from and you pick the meat, bun, and all the toppings you want.   I got the buffalo burger with caramelized onions cheese and bacon. It was amazing and cooked to perfection. A place that will actually cook a burger the way you want!   The sweet potato fries are great as well!   if you are on the strip or are just in the mood for a gourmet burger this is the place to go!
1336	0	This is one of the worst buffets in Las Vegas. And they have extremely high prices for the quality of food. I have now tried it about 4 times and every time I say NEVER AGAIN. This time...I mean it. Unless they show some serious transformation, I will never return. I like to try a buffet every now and then in Vegas. I have been to some exceptional ones. This isn't one of them. Try Caesar's Palace, Wynn, or Bellagio. This place is horrible. Trust me. I stay at Mandalay Bay every time, and am so disappointed by the quality of this buffet. The food is almost inedible. I wouldn't spend $5 to eat here. I would rather go to Golden Corral.

828	1	Someone told us (my boyfriend and I) to find the Secret Pizza joint at the Cosmopolitan, and that we would LOVE it. And, after 30 minutes of searching for this place, we feel in LOVE with this place! (the alcohol might have helped)   I encourage everyone to adventure/trek/ search for this place. And when you find the place, order the White Pie Pizza - it's to die for!! Yummy yummy in my tummy. We also suggested this "pizza place" to our friend's parents who are of Sicilian decent, and they stated that the white pie pizza reminds them of their family made pizza from Sicily.
463	0	Our room was outdated at least 20 years. All the carpets throughout the halls were terribly stained. Our tv did not work, nor did our phone. Could not call for room service. Had to call out to some nasty Italian food place. Couldn't even sign in to their promised wifi. No one seemed to care!!! Oh yea, plus a resort fee of $15.00 per day! And tax on top of that!!!???!!!  This place is far from a resort. The pool needs to be dug up and resized to accommodate the amount of people and hotel size ratio! I had really looked forward to this little get away, kick back and get a tan. So much for that, very non-appealing....no space! This place is a dive!!!
1176	1	Awesome place. Looks really cool, plates, silverware good presentation was all very unique and cool.  The food wasn't huge portion, but the taste is incredible. Fries, dessert and burgers were all so good. When we go back to Vegas, we are coming back!  Decent prices too!!
448	0	Don't get the food.. It's a rip off! I went to the outside window because I didn't feel like waiting for the restaurant. We got sliders.. they were whatever.. overpriced.  I only wanted to go to try the famous hot chocolate. It was good..Nothing amazing, honestly. I really think Dunkin's is comparable. Had to do it to say I did it!
1398	1	After such a great experience back in July (see Gregg M's review) we decided that this would be the perfect spot to go for a wedding "reception".  Special thanks to Sandra B from group sales at Total Rewards for making this group reservation for us.  The meal was everything I wanted it to be - impeccably delivered and absolutely delicious.  I could not have asked for better service.  I would say there was only one thing that may have put a damper on things had I not been in such a wonderful mood - but more on that later.  My husband and I decided to get the Hells Kitchen tasting menu.  We chose not to get the wine pairings since we wanted people to get what they felt like drinking, rather than be limited to what was part of the wine pairings.  The sommelier was on hand to help us out with decisions.    i personally decided I wanted a cocktail to start out with - though I don't remember the name of it, it was delicious with cucumber and gin and other subtle flavors that made it very refreshing and a perfect beginning to our meal.    As with our previous visit, the amuse bouche and third course were exactly the same as our previous visit.  The scotch egg was as delicious as I remember it from July and the Beef Wellington - sublime.  Though I will say after making it with a friend for New Years, I wish I this version would have had more of the duxelles that helps make the Wellington what it is - delicious   The differences:  The first course was a beet salad.  Perfectly roasted beets with a hint of horseradish and the second course - though it was a scallop risotto, the risotto was made with farro, black trumpets and pecorino cheese (I have to say I think I liked the differences!).    Though this was not a different course - it bear mentioning all by itself.  Dessert.  How can you not like brown butter ice cream?  Pair that with some sticky toffee pudding and you have the best dessert ever (yes even better than chocolate!).   Heaven!  The only down side was the cognac service.  I really wish they would have explained to all of my guests what cognacs they had and what the price points were.  They brought out the Louis the XIII for this service ($200/glass) as well as some other much less expensive choices.  Though there were a few people who know cognacs and can truly appreciate the differences in a Louis XIII, I'm not sure if all of the guests that ordered Louis XIII would have, had they known its cost.  For the most part - some only saw the pretty bottle.    Even with this one slight hiccup - We still had a 5-star experience.  Thanks for a great meal!
690	1	I don't know how I've lived in Vegas for so long and haven't gone to Bouchon because I've been really missing out on great food and exceptional service. It was a bit hard to find and didn't realize that you could get to the elevators from the garage area instead of walking all around in circles.   My boyfriend and I got there on a Sunday a little after noon and it was very busy but we didn't mind the wait because we were able to explore the pool area and enjoy the beautiful cool weather. After reading some of the specials of the day I had already decided on getting the a Rock Shrimp Hash before we were even seated.   We received a text message that our table was ready and we were promptly seated. Very shortly our waiter Matt came over to get our drink orders. I wasn't sure which champagne cocktail I wanted and he suggested Strawberry Fields. I was extremely happy with this suggestion because I didn't want the typical Mimosa or Bellini and it was not overly sweet but the perfect amount of strawberry flavor.  We then placed out food orders, but unfortunately they had run out of the rock Shrimp Hash that Matt said was deeeelicious (our fault for getting there so late).  I decided to order the Moules au Safran et  la Moutarde, which are mussels steamed in white wine, mustard, saffron and served with fries (or as they call it pommes frites). The boyfriend got the Chicken and Waffles which was another dish recommended by our server. Both dishes were amazing! I could not stop reaching over and stealing bites out of his Chicken and Waffles! Definitely a fan of Bouchon, not only because of the delicious food, but also the phenomenal service!
1283	1	You won't have :better" pizza anywhere.  As good, perhaps, but not better. No way.  Had a slice of white and a slice of the pepperoni and wow.  From the crust to the perfect amount of cheese the right amount of toppings ... it's a secret only because there are no signs and unless you spot a person walking out with a pizzza box or slice on a plate you would never think to go down some random hallway ... but the secret is out.  The place was packed (very little seating) with people ordering deliciousness.    Will definitely go back on my next Vegas visit.
539	0	Not a fine dining of course, it's more of a causal grab a bit kind of place. The Singaporean noodle was good. Spring rolls were average. I expected a bit more from the place in terms of food quality in lieu of it being in Bellagio. PS mango pudding was okay too!
561	0	Never have I been so dissatisfied with a dining establishment. The only thing more awful than the food, was my server, Lucy. We waited for 30 minutes to be sat (which I was fine with), THEN we waited about 45 minutes for tacos that tasted like they we're fresh  out of the microwave.  Twice, I had to get up to find my server so I could order drinks & both times she seemed like she was bothered. (Do your job girl, then your customers won't have to). I am usually not a tough critic when it comes to resteraunts, or service but senior frogs deserves ZERO stars. The only reason I am even giving them one star is because there is a nice view of the strip outside. Five thumbs down for seor frogs.
1806	1	The best burger place in Vegas, bar none. The truffled edamame are the perfect way to start, then you really can't go wrong with any burger on the menu. Best ingredients and thick, homemade patties. My mouth is seriously watering right now as I'm typing this. If you live anywhere near a Bachi Burger, treat yourself to the best burger of your life.
1347	1	We had reservations at 5pm on a Friday. We wanted reservations at 6pm but couldn't get in. We were concerned it was too early but really had no choice. It turned out prefect because our server asked about our plans for the evening & we told him we had a show to catch at 9 so he planned the timing of our courses. They took their time & brought everything out at a prefect time! Loved it! That was so thoughtful of them!  I have to say we had the best time, meal & service at Gordan Ramsay Steak during our short stay in Vegas! The atmosphere was nice & dim even though it was a little loud in there. We had oysters on the half shell, foie gras, ribeye, lamb, truffle fingerling potatoes, asparagus, bone morrow & the sticky toffee pudding.   Oysters were prefect! There were 3 different kinds of oysters & it came with 3 different sauces to top off. The foie gras was amazing! It was our first time having foie gras. I've seen what it looked like but wasn't sure how the taste & texture was. We loved it & will definitely have it more often! The foie gras had a nice sear on the outside & it came with 2 small pop overs that had gooseberries & gooseberry sauce. It was delicious! Everything paired so nicely! The ribeye was cooked to perfection! There was a nice char on the outside from the grill & the inside was nice & medium rare, how we ordered it. It didn't come with sides so we ordered the truffle fingerling potatoes - it was just ok to me & the asparagus -this was delish! Cooked perfectly! The lamb came with 1 lamb chop, a small Shepards pie, roasted carrots & mashed potatoes. Loved everything except the pie was too salty for me. The bone morrow was just ok. I've had better. I didn't care for that green sauce on top. Not even sure what it was. The dessert, sticky toffee pudding was to die for!!!!!! It was like a small cake & they poured toffee sauce on top & it came with brown butter ice cream shaped like a stick of butter. Heaven!! Soooooo good! The coffee came in a french press & they even provided 3 complimentary chocolate spoons (had alky in it) to stir into your coffee. I passed on that since I'm pregnant but hubby tried it. Be careful, he said it was pretty sweet so you might not want to use all the chocolate.  Very pricy but definitely a must try, at least once.
1033	0	I love burgers, so I really wanted to love I Love Burgers.  I loved the friendly hostesses.  I loved the friendly woman working at the counter.  I didn't love the over cooked, dry burger.  I didn't love the under cooked fatty bacon they slapped on my over cooked dry burger.  So five stars for the employees, but only 2 stars for the food.
154	1	Had an early dinner here with my bff.  We shared a liter of wine, and it was the best stinkin cab I have ever had.  Sadly, I don't remember what it was.. maybe cuz of the 1/2 liter of wine I had that night.  haha.    The food here is amazing!  Started with the hazelnut beet salad and wine glazed pork belly.. the salad had pickled ramps that were so tasty!  No strong onion flavor.. it almost tasted like asparagus with a light spring onion taste. And the pork belly was crispy and creamy at the same time!  Served with a ramp custard, the two were a match made in heaven.    For the main course, I had the pork loin served with a baked ramp custard, roasted Anjou pears and morels... To die for! Kinda tasted like Korean food.. which is a good thing.  Pork and green onion pancake (sahm gyup sal and pah jun).  My friend had the lamb, but I can't say too much about that since I don't like lamb.  :)  For dessert.. we had the creme brulee and Ill Flotante.  The creme brulee was pretty standard, but the ill flotante was like a fluffy cloud of dreamy goodness.  Haha.  it was soooo amazing!  airy meringue in a sea of anglaise and a little gravy boat of fleur de sel caramel sauce.. holy mother of all good desserts.    For the two of us, we spent close to 300.. yes, it's pricey, but for a splurge meal, it's as good as it gets!
276	0	I would say the 3 stars is representative of how the restaurant's food is but for some reason our service was terrible.   There's a to-go window right next door for those who don't want to wait 15-20 min. I came by for lunch on a Saturday at around noon, and placed an order of the beef Thai salad at the to-go window since we were hungry and wanted something to eat while we waited.  Once we got inside, for some reason it took forever to flag down a waitress. When we ordered (orange smoothie, ABC burger and pizza with onions and spinach), she came back 5 minutes later asking me to repeat my order, and if I wanted it for here or to go. What the hell is that supposed to mean? If I'm dining inside the restaurant, why would I want it to go??  When the food finally arrived, the order was wrong - they gave us pizza with mushrooms and spinach, and the burger came with a side of french fries which I didn't want - the waitress never asked us for our preference on the side. I asked the server to bring back a side of the coleslaw instead of the fries.   At first I was going to give this restaurant 2 stars but thinking back on the experience, that one waitress definitely ruined it for me.
74	0	Literally every section has the same three items ( bacon, eggs, and sausages). There's a very small selection. This will be my last time eating here. Awful food and service during breakfast. I'm highly disappointed that I wasted my money and time waiting in line.
1664	1	Nice Resturant in Ventitian.  staying in venitian and looking for a good place for brunch so gave this plae a try.  and were happy with our choice. I ordered egg benedit with smoked salmon and of course french toast :) and love it.  coffee was good, service is good also. much better choice for brunch than the buffet in vegas.  it has a nice ambience as well.  if I stay in venetian that is the place for brunch for sure .  haven't tried their dinner, but I am sure it sholdbe good as well. next time :)
1076	1	I've been to the Egg & I several times, and each time breakfast has been great.  Went once with my wife and I and sat outside and enjoyed one of their excellent scrambles and a delicious benedict, both of which we really enjoyed.    The second visit was this past weekend with my parents and brother and sister in law.  Food and service were both fantastic.  I had the chicken and chorizo breakfast burrito, while others enjoyed the cordon bleu skillet, a chorizo skillet, a french dip sandwich with cajun fries and an eggs benedict.  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food, which was brought very quickly given how packed the place was - talk about an efficient kitchen.  Our cups (water and coffee) never ran dry and the waiter struck the perfect balance between leaving us be to enjoy our meals and making sure we got what we need.  Will definitely be back in the future to this outstanding place.  Love it!
1783	0	The decor is kind of the most interesting part of the whole thing. We came at the tail end of breakfast it's all self served. The food was meh not the best. The reason they got two stars and not one is, I really wanted waffles. They where out but were able to scrounge up a few in the back. To bad they where soggy but they got a star for effort.
970	1	I LOVE Burger Bar. So much. As a local, I really try to avoid the Strip as much as possible. But this place has become a staple in my family. When we think burgers, we think Burger Bar...so it's well worth the drive down the Strip to get there.  Depending on when you go dictates how long the wait is. We've waited anywhere from 10 minutes to over an hour. They won't seat you unless everyone in your party is present (which I can appreciate, having worked in the restaurant industry), so if you're waiting for people to arrive, I recommend at least getting your name on the list. That way, when everyone DOES arrive, you can just let the hostess know your party is ready and your wait time will be shortened.  It's usually pretty loud in there. If you're looking for a quiet meal, this definitely isn't the place to go. It's got a bit of a sports bar feel to it, with sports games playing on both the big screens and the small TV screens inside the booths. But everybody always seems to be having a good time, and I can still manage to have a conversation with my table without having to shout at anybody.  They have the Chef's burgers menu, and also have build-your-own options for burgers and milkshakes (both alcoholic and not). They have non-beef options, such as chicken, turkey, or salmon. They even have a veggie burger and a specialty vegan burger, along with various salad options for all the non-meat eaters out there. All of the Chef's burgers come with skinny fries, but you can change those out for any of their other side options. (I usually opt for sweet potato fries.) If you do a build-your-own, you can add on those side options for $3-6.  I personally am OBSESSED with the Hubert Keller burger. I mean, I dream about this burger. I wake up craving it. And then I bug everyone I know to give me an excuse to go get one. It's a buffalo burger topped with sauteed baby spinach, caramelized onions, and blue cheese. Each component on that burger compliments every other component. It comes with a Red Wine Shallot reduction on the side, and it just puts the burger over the top. It took a couple visits for me to get my dad to try it (he was scared of buffalo meat for some reason), but I practically shoved a bite down his throat and now he's hooked. Buffalo meat is amazing!  A close second (in my opinion) would have to be the Peppercorn burger. If you're a fan of pepper and mustard, THIS is the burger for you.  Then of course, there are the milkshakes. Holy crap! So yummy! I've had both the Nutella and the Salted Caramel milkshakes. Both are sooo delicious. When ordering shakes "for here" they are decorated beautifully. Very artistic. But you can also order them to-go, and they'll put it in a plastic cup with a nice wide straw so you can take it with you.   I also recommend the Creamy Cheese Cake burger. This is a dessert alternative to the milkshake, filled with sweetened cream cheese and caramelized pineapple. The "bun" is made with fresh donuts! Mmm Mmm! They're a little small though, so...unless you just want a bite, I recommend skipping the "Let's split a dessert" part of the conversation and just keep it all to yourself.  We've never once had a bad experience here. Our servers have always been friendly, they are mindful of any modifications we make, and our burgers are always cooked to perfection. Service CAN be a little slow though. Depending on how busy they are, it may be hard to track down said server for drink refills or extra sauce. And once they take your order, you can expect to be sitting there twiddling your thumbs for 15-20 minutes with nothing on the table but beverages. (There is also a longer wait on the dessert burgers.) But! They DO cook everything to order, so it's completely understandable and well worth that wait.
1546	1	Boyfriend and I came here on a whim.  It was our first day on our Vegas Vacation, and we came in hungry.  We both love burgers, and we were staying in the Luxor.  As Luxor is connected to Mandalay Bay, Burger bar was close.  Absolutely delicious.  I made my own burger and my boyfriend got the buffalo burger.  We were both blown away.  Serious deliciousness.  The service was also prompt.  We came in for lunch, so I don't know if the dinner crowd and service may be different, but our experience was quick, friendly, and hands down delicious.  We will definitely be back.  YAY for BURGER BAR!!
23	1	The Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino has a secret and it's hidden on the third floor!  Take the escalator up to the 3rd floor.  As you exit the escalator, there is a hallway directly in front of you to the left of Jaleo (tapas restaurant).  Follow this hallway until it ends and there you will find some of the best pizza on the Las Vegas strip.  Seriously, I saw people waiting in line for crap pizza outside, when they could have easily come here for pizza that is 100 times better.  Sold by the slice or whole, this small spot offers a variety of pies to choose from.  Although it's primarily a counter, there is a small amount of space to eat at.  If not, just go eat in the lounge area directly outside the hidden hallway.  I ordered two pepperoni slices for $5.25 each.  They had just come out of the oven so they were hot.  The cheese was really good and gooey as was the pepperoni itself.  This is definitely worth a visit if you're in the mood for a few slices of pizza.
1264	1	Honestly what better way to combat a hangover in Vegas than a cheesy pizza loaded with meats and veggies...hot and ready to order? Yeah, nothing. This review wont be long I swear...because I want you guys to just find this place....on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan...exit out the elevator to your left...then quickly to your right...spot the hallway after the Jaleo Restaurant and make a right down the hallway..... and see the glorious yet tiny SECRET PIZZA place. It's everything your heart desires. Whatever you want, order it- This place is where dreams come true. I was craving a good pizza place, absent of the fancy Vegas pretentiousness and I found it. Made to order. Orgasmic. You gotta do it guys...
1496	0	This place can't possibly love burgers!  On a short trip to Vegas while staying in the Plazzo we decided to have dinner at I Love Burgers.  We were greeted, seated, asked what we wanted to drink, cokes delivered, then order taken, everything was normal at that point.  While we sat and talked time slipped by and 30-40 minutes went by without anyone checking on us.    Our waitress came to the table and told us that our order had been lost by the system; we were finally brought our Mac and Cheese Fries after another 10 minutes all the while sucking the tail end of a coke.    When our burgers were delivered they were dry, dry to the bone, tasteless poor excuses for a hamburger, not to mention a 16 dollar hamburger not including fries.  When the waitress came by and asked us how everything was (at that most inopportune time when you have a mouthful of food) my wife said "Well, the bun is good."  The waitress said great and motored on.  I have to say you will find a better burger at 5 guys, or even Red Robin.  Not only we will not be returning on our next trip, but we tell all of our friends about the awful time we had.
803	0	I had previously stayed at this hotel when it was the Las Vegas Hilton... at that time they were going through a renovation and apparently also changing the name... This was like 3-5 years ago.. Sadly, since then nothing has changed.  The one thing I remember that I did not like were the long long lines and wait times for the elevator.  There are two problems, there are not enough elevators and also they are not dedicated to lets say for example 1-20 floor and then another set of elevators for 30-40 floors.  When checking in, I opted to upgrade the room for $20... and was amazed that they called it 'an upgraded room'.  According to travelocity, this is a 4 star hotel... this room was more like a 2 star, so I can just imagine what the regular room looked like.  The room itself, the tub spout was coming off of the wall, it was leaking water and the tub didn't have a light... The ac/heater thermostat was not digital... and the door key/knob stopped reading cards... I was hard pressed to find any renovations to this room.
1962	1	OPMG can't go wrong with anything! But my favorite is the the hammered pork tenderloin eggs benedict with cream sauce!!!!!!!!!1 Its bigger than my freaking head and I only finished 2/3s of the damn thing soooo goood.... the bacon cream sauce they put on that thing is so delicious.... and my runnder up is not the sage fried chicken eggs benedict pretty massive and really good..... Coming here is my new Vegas tradition!
1153	1	It was a Saturday night and a group of 9 of us decided to get together and catch up. Haven't been to Bachi in a long time so we decided on dinner around 7. It was definitely busy for a weekend, but that was to be expected.  The host took down our name and quoted an estimated time of seating to be around 15-20 minutes. We waited patiently, the host did a great job controlling the flow of the restaurant and seated us right around the quoted wait time.    We sat down and Jade greeted us with a smile. She was friendly, prompt, and professional. Some of us had not been there before, so she went through the menu and addressed all the questions that some of us had. She suggested some cocktails and drinks along with her favorites on the menu. We proceeded with some shared appetizers and that arrived, we ordered our entrees. We loved the fact that everyone was served at the same time with entrees and our drinks were constantly filled. Jade checked up on us frequently and was very engaging, yet she let us have our space when needed. Since there was 9 of us, a good variation of the menu was ordered. The ramen I had was perfect! Not too salty, not to spicy, it was perfect! Everyone who ordered burgers was touting how well it was prepared and the cocktails were a hit. We loved that the manager Erika not only came by to say hello and check up on us, but she is every engaging with the entire restaurant.  She even ran some of our food to our table.  At the end of our night, dessert was ordered. Can't remember what we had but it was wonderful, definitely satisfied our sweet tooth! Jade asked if we wanted split checks for such a large party, we declined but was pleasantly surprised that the check was already split based on seating position. Not only was it split in each seating position, it was done correctly. We were impressed not just but the deliciousness of the food, the hustle and bustle of the restaurant, but also the staff. They were all friendly and definitely was a hit with everyone. We will for sure see you all soon! Bravo!
909	0	I generally don't like making reviews so soon after going some place; I prefer to stew around, ask others in the party what they thought, and try to make a well rounded review ... you know, be all pretentious about it.  But, after having dinner here last night and having an extra hour or so while the rest of the family goes off to gamble, I had to vent my disgust with the Grand Buffet here at the MGM Grand.  First off, dinner on a weeknight costs upwards of $39.99 a person, which makes the buffet here one of the pricier ones on the strip.  For comparison, the Wynn and Cosmopolitan charge a buck less on weeknights ($38.99), the Bellagio charges $36.99, and, just to throw it in there, one of my preferred Vegas buffets at the Rio is a scant $32.99 per adult.  So, the MGM charges more than the newer and swankier places in Vegas.  And what do you get for that extra cost?  The short answer is nothing to make it worth it.  When I come to buffets, I don't expect anything more than a lot of average fare.  Typically, you can hope to find most things be not too disgusting, with one or two items that jump above the line, and an equal number than dive well below it.  Here, everything feels dried out from too much time under the heat lamps, meats are under seasoned or overcooked, breads are stale or oddly chewy, and then a couple of high points.  Starting with the carving station, the steaks are flavorless, with no char from the grill, no salty melt to the beef, and most everything we had filled with gristle.  The ribs were overcooked, the fatty trim burned to dry coarseness that was akin to bad chicharrones.   The Prime Rib was overcooked, no pink, close to over seasoned (why couldn't they sprinkle some of that on everything else?), and sharing those ribbons of gristle that ruined the steaks before them.  And, finally, those kielbasas ... well, they were just bad.  The Mexican / Latin station had a bad rendition of Carnitas, which were overly laden with unnecessary vegetables instead of flavoring them with just whatever acid they broke down the protein with and the simmer from cooking it down in its own salty fat.  And the pizza ... my toddler son who normally loves such things, wouldn't even touch it.  On the average end of the scale, the Brussel Sprouts were alright, a bit tough as they didn't seem to be steamed to soften up before roasting, but were also coated in the strong, acrid taste of fennel.    The sushi station was on point for a typical buffet, though not for a $40 a plate one.  They had Octopus Nigiri, an atypical selection, and had a good chew to it along with a fair flavor that didn't have an overly fishy taste.  Salmon rolls had jalapeo slivers with nice heat.  But, on the flip side, no California Rolls or any normal sushi fare you would expect to enjoy.  Macaroni Cheese was fair, tasting fresher than out of the box, and good enough for parents to bite and enjoy while kids feasted on it.  And over at the Asian station, the Egg Rolls were average, if not common / everyday.  Pot stickers are poorly made, none of them cooked down long enough for the skins to become gummy and firm like they should have been, but they still were pretty good, even if they readily fell apart.  And Fried Rice is almost always good.  On the high end, the Shrimp Diablo was fantastic, a good cut to the shellfish, perfectly cooked, and served in a wine sauce with fair heat that was really outstanding.  And the Pear and Gorgonzola Ravioli were a nice blend of sweet and salty, well cooked, and sauced in, what I remember being, a butter cream that made it my favorite dish of the night.  Oh, and their dessert is pretty standard, not quite worth the price tag, but still a good representation of what you should see at a higher end Vegas buffet on the strip.  Plus, they have Ghirardelli sauces!  So, in the end, more disappointments than readily edible food.  Nothing was horrendous, but none of it truly stood out in amazement that came anywhere near warranting the $40 price tag.  I think the greatest mark against this place is all of the poor Yelp reviews that have been tagged by MGM management with their thanks and promise of review ... yet, none of these slights seemed to have been improved in any way whatsoever!  Anyway, if you dropped the cost down to $25 on a weeknight, it might be a solid three stars.  As of right now, it's a very weak two stars in my eyes.
837	1	Drunk food at its best! This little gem is hidden in Cosmo. Came here after a crazy night at Marquee. I was actually surprised the line wasn't longer but there was still a good amount of people. Line moves quick so no worries.   Pizza slices are about $5 but really depends what you get. I tried the White Pizza and the Pepperoni and they were both amazing. My favorite one was the White Pizza. Not sure if I was just drunk and hungry or if the pizza was just THAT good.
1829	1	We ordered the gangnam combo for 2 and a couple of happy hour specials. Service is fast  Beef toro and prok belly are decent  Mushroom medley is cooked already  Korean choke ken cheese fondue is very tender  Combo for 2 can feed more than 2 by the way A lot of the meat are in the sweeter side though
1898	0	What is there to add?   ROOMS  PLUS-Room in the Monaco Tower was clean, the bed comfortable, the water pressure fantastic, and a tub that drained quickly.   MINUS-My brother booked the conference rate....big mistake   CONFERENCE CENTER  PLUS-Lots of rooms and adaptable to the needs of our workshop   MINUS-Time warp to the '80s   CASINO  PLUS-The lights were on and the machines worked   MINUS-Dowdy, rundown, and stank of encrusted smoke   FOOD/OTHER SERVICES  PLUS-None (the lights were on)   Minus-Only went to the buffet for dinner. Better bet: exit the hotel and go to the Peppermill next door.   I'm not quite sure how the Riviera survives in the cut-throat environment of the Strip. They must get enough bus tours and conferences to keep the dollars flowing. It is convenient to Circus Circus and a short walk to the Wynn. If you are looking for an experience of the Strip today, keeping walking. If you want a cheap room in a run down hotel, the Riviera is the place for you.
283	1	Took us over 30 minutes to find, we thought there would be signs. Right as we were giving up and heading out to eat somewhere else we asked and were directed to a dark hallway second story of cosmopolitan. Worth the 30 minutes to find!!! Pizza is constantly being made, staff is really friendly. Let me talk about the cheese!!! You've seen those commercials with the cheese oozing out of the pizza and when you bite it the cheese literally stretches out from your mouth to pizza well this pizza has all that! Best cheese on pizza I've had. Drinks are pretty pricey for just a small cup $4 other than that everything was great and this is going to be a MUST stop next time we go to Las Vegas.
79	1	The service was awesome; very fast, helpful, cheerful, and polite! And the food was absolutely delicious. I visited this place twice during one visit to Vegas bc I couldnt get enough of it :) My favorite was the Drunken Sea Bass, Red Curry, pork larb, and the mint duck... all reasonably priced. I know thai food and this is it, yum.
358	1	Our server Patrick was exceptional and the food delicious.  I had the chili rellano omelette and it was a flavor explosion!  The Diablo potatoes that come with it are amazing.  Couldn't stop eating them!Yummy! You get a free banana nut muffin for checking in on Yelp.  It was warm and tasty.
779	0	Clean and sterile like an operating room.....  Such a strange feeling to walk into Lee's Sandwiches, which is not quite a yogurt store, grocery store, or a sandwich shop, but some type of odd mixture.  There are overpriced "Imported from France" goods for sale on a few shelves throughout the store.  It's a random selection of cookies, teas, and other things you probably wouldn't buy when you're cruising for a sandwich.  The yogurt machines are on the wall, like you would see at a yogurt store, but I'm not sure about the topping selection; it looked sparse at best.   Now, onto the sandwiches.  The menu on the wall above the registers is big and colorful.  The pictures look exactly like the sandwiches do, which normally would be a great thing, but here it's a disappointment.  I went with the BBQ Pork sandwich.  These are in the style of Bhan Mi, but really subpar.  The bread is missing that great crisp you expect from a baguette.  The flavor of the sandwich was muted as well, and even biting into big slices of jalapenos and bunches of cilantro I couldn't really get into the sandwich.    There is now a $10 CC minimum if you plan on using plastic, but really, you're better off just going somewhere else.
138	0	On our 3 day streak eating buffet (we've been to Bellagio, Mirage, and Wynn for dinner/lunch), Aria buffet was the worst quality of foods, and unbelievably unfriendly staff off all hotels. Fail expectations for the price.   Rancid shrimp dumpling (Har gow), so bad I spit it out. Shrimp cocktail that still has its shell unremoved. Oysters were fishy and sloppy, a sign that expired. Cold king crags legs that were overcooked. People went through them because a. Lot of them were just undesirable and people picked all over them leaving only scraps. Nothing remarkable.  Esther showed us to our table. She failed to let us in after we had walked to check out the food, only to tell us to go back to end of line, no exception. She unwilling to make better of the situation by letting us use mlife line.  Staff only care about their responsibilities and won't call server too come to you, even though ours was no where to be found.  Don't go here for buffet. Terrible food terrible service.  Tip: go to Wynn for best flood Best service.
404	0	Half of everything was ok, the other half more on the so so side.   We arrived at 10:45 which was between the lunch and breakfast time.    They had a line forming with no one to explain that they would not be seating anyone until 11:00.   That was a bit of a turn off.    Also, a crepe bar where the woman has never heard of a crepe suzette???   The service was ok.
259	1	Celiac/Gluten-Free Review: A group of friends and I visited Bouchon for dessert. Knowing Thomas Keller is associated with the GF Cup4Cup flour, I knew there wouldn't be any problem finding gluten free options. It didn't disappoint! All of the staff were very knowledgeable, and I had the signature GF bouchons with garden mint ice cream. My dish came out on a special non-branded plate indicating to me that they were special plates for food allergy sufferers, so even the non-servers who brought out our food knew what was going on.  Top notch and extremely safe for Celiacs to enjoy some sweets! (If you aren't able to eat at the Bistro itself, the Bouchon Bakeries in the Venetian have giant macarons as a GF option.)
336	1	I had to add a star for getting to meet Gordon Ramsay. He was genuinely a nice guy. Had some drinks and split a burger at the bar, it was a fantastic burger. Tender and flavorful. The bar staff is as friendly as the rest of the staff that we have encountered.
1499	0	Hotel was basic, not too good, not too bad. What made this hotel the worst hotel experience was: 1. that they charged some things that were supposed to be included in the plan paid 2. The people at front desk does not know about customer care. They will treat you really bad when you show them they are charging you more than the amount agreed.  By the way, there was blood on the floor elevator when we arrived  Make sure you check your bill before you leave!!
1815	0	45 minute wait in line? Really??? Seriously? Ridiculous!!  There were lots of tables either open or needing to be bussed and that line would have moved a LOT better.   Almost missed my cirque show cause of this place. You come to a buffet cause you want to come in sit down, eat, and move on. Well not this place!
996	0	The sports book and buffet here are great and gambling is cheap during the morning but I will never stay here again... first they charge you 20 dollar a day resort fee THEN if you want to use the weight room you have to pay ANOTHER 20 DOLLARS A DAY!!!! sorry but no other hotel has ever charged 2 resort fees for two different gym AT THE SAME HOTEL!!!! lvh love your sports book but ill never stay here again the rooms are ok but I can pay a cheaper resort fee and hotel rate else where and it will be better
1185	1	Everyone has to eat here at least once in their life!  Let's go straight to the point:  - MORE THAN ENOUGH portions and FULL of flavour - Excellent service: prompt, polite, and accommodating  - Clean inside and outside of restaurant  American classics with a twist. They're a bit pricey but it's so worth it! There's also a 24/7 location inside The Quad to satisfy your late-night munchies. The top item in the menu is the 'Sage Fried Chicken Benedict' and is highly recommended for you first-timers and the hollandaise sauce is the star of the dish. A good place to bring a date and pig out, feed each other, or share one item since the portions are huge.   COME HERE.
1075	1	Had so much fun at Lotus of Siam - a unique experience when compared to the celeb-chef loaded, overpriced spots on the strip that's definitely worth the cab ride out.  It's low-key, no need to get dressed up, and they're dead serious about reservations - will only hold your table for 5 minutes. Obviously, they're masters of tom yum soup - and any other variety.  I ordered mine mild, because I'm a baby, and they obliged - but one of my companions ordered "insane spicy" and they certainly did that too - he was in a lot of pain.  The crispy rice with pork and scallions absolutely rocks - one of my favorite thai dishes I've ever tried.  Broad drunken noodles, red curry, and a whole fish rounded out the meal.  Such a fun experience, highly recommended.
669	0	Ambience was nice, food and service not so much.   I ordered the "live well" omelet. The egg whites were fluffy but the lobster was nearly non existent. Every time I thought I saw a piece, it turned out to be a tomato. Asparagus was plentiful.   The "fruit" it comes with is cantaloupe only, even tho their description of mixed fruit includes berries and seasonal fruit. Cantaloupe is literally the only fruit I don't like (I'm not a picky eater). When asked if I can get a different fruit the answer was honeydew or cantaloupe ONLY. Then it should say it's served with melon, not fruit. The waiter was also not accommodating when my husband asked for onions on his hash browns, saying they already come with onions. We didn't see any.   On the upside we had a beautiful view of the gardens and the coffee was good. A better server could've changed our experience.
1936	1	Best burgers hands down. Eating at one of Ramsey's restaurants is like my life long pursuit as I've been a big fan of his for years. After studying the menus from 3 Ramsey's restaurants in Vegas, we decided on this one simply because it fits our budget .   Went there at night and the wait was 2 hours, so we came back the next day and tried lunch instead, got in right away. We tried their blue burger and farm burger (with duck breast bacon and fried egg) and requested them medium rare and they were absolutely cooked to perfection. The outside was evenly cooked and the inside was pink and just melt in our mouths. Ramsey definitely delivered and we were not disappointed!!  The fries were great too with homemade ketchup and aioli sauce. The #4 shake of Oreo and Creme brle was creative and not bad. What was not good was the dessert "sticky toffee pudding push-up pops". They tasted just like vanilla ice cream layered with chocolate cake while they were supposed to be salted peanut ice cream. So don't order that.   Overall though I still give it 5 stars because the burgers were truly the best we had ever had. And now I can finally say I've eaten at one of Ramsey's restaurants.
1730	1	boyfriends family took us to dinner here since we were in town and we are sooooo obsessed! We are already planning to go back when in town again!!   We started with the oxtail chili cheese fries, truffle fries and onion rings! OMG! delicious! I swear the best truffle fries I have ever had cause they glazed the top with the oil too!   I had the Kalbi burger and the fam had the miso, black and green, and the bahn mi burger my burger was korean bbq goodness, with the kimchi and everything! A must try! I had a bite of all the burgers on the table and was not disappointed. Ended with the lava cake for dessert and that also was delish! order it when you order the burgers as it take about 20-25 min to make =)  definitely cannot wait to try the other locations (since they have different menus)   Loveee this place!
1678	0	LAME....  As a hot dog connoisseur, I was pissed that I came here. Mainly because it's hyped up so much and did not deliver in the slightest.   Compared to Capital Dawg in Sacramento, I was NOT impressed.   I ordered a dog with pastrami and mustard. The mustard was all I tasted and the pastrami was weak and hell. No salty goodness, just sliced meat with no flavor.   What a bummer. Guess I've got to stick to Capital Dawg and Costco to get my fixes!
1542	0	Two weeks ago I headed to TAO nightclub with a girlfriend and our boyfriends. Bringing the guys was our first mistake. We went because 50 Cent was hosting the evening. That was our second mistake.  Even with guestlist, free passes and wrist bands, we still waited a solid TWO hours to enter the club. The bouncers told us, point blank, that if we hadn't brought our boyfriends, we'd be in the door right away. 'Nuff said.  50 Cent arrived around 1 a.m. and, after a quick photo-op, I'm quite certain he went through the club, out the back door and left. He wasn't seen again for the rest of the night.   By the time we got in, it was packed shoulder-to-shoulder, the bars were impossible to access and room to dance did not exist. Needless to say, I was only more than happy to get out of there. Without purchasing bottle service, you can forget sitting down anywhere.  To be fair, I'm sure TAO would be great on any other night. The decor is stunning, the dancers are beautiful, the venue is spacious and the music was fantastic. However, next time we're in Vegas, there are a lot of other nightclubs I'd be more inclined to check-out before I give TAO another shot.
1432	1	Womp..... OF COURSE THIS PLACE GETS 5 STARS.  Trust me, I wanted to break the best-pizza-ever-i-promise streak!!!! But... its THE BEST PIZZA EVER, I PROMISE! I lived in the New Jersey/New York area for quite some time so I've tried pizzas from Hoboken to Brooklyn. Let me tell you, this pizza can DEFINITELY compare. I swear there's something in their water. Their crust made me jizz my pants.   If there's a line.. just WAIT. Please experience this ride for yourself.  Takes your pizza dreams where they've never gone before.   Also, they offer hipster beers (pbr, etc) for cheaps!  Can't wait for another marquee/secret pizza night in VLV.
1065	1	Holy crap where do I start??? Tldr: if you're reading this, just go there as soon as you can.   We went on a Sunday morning, for a lazy brunch and that's exactly what it was.   The menu options are EXTENSIVE. Lots of sweet and savory options. We ordered the Brad's Scramble and Waffle with a banana nut muffin on the side. I'd read tons of reviews about the muffin so I wanted to know what the hype was all about.   And I was BLOWN AWAY. This is one of the yummiest, tastiest muffins I've had in my life. And this set the bar really, really high for me.   Then the waffle - with a nice layer of whipped cream and blueberries was perfect.   Scrambled eggs were great as well. The potatoes were really excellent! Cooked perfectly and coated with the Hablo Diabla spice, not too spicy - just right.   When we went to settle the check, there was a mixup and they charged us with someone else's bill. But they handled the situation well, and fixed the goof up very humbly.   The staff was always nice and sweet.   This is in stark comparison to the fancier places we dined over the weekend, where the staff was very curt and hostile at best.   Will definitely come back, just for those muffins awww man.
556	1	So far this is the best pizza I've ever had.  I really like thin crust NY style and this is definitely it.  The place can be found on the third floor of The Cosmopolitan Hotel, right by the exit from Marquee.  The best IMO is the white pizza...I tried the mushroom and it was just OK.  It's $4 a slice which is reasonable, if you think it's a rip-off what the hell are you doing at the Cosmo in the first place??
150	1	The dipping sauces for the grilled meat were great! Highly recommend the happy hour. I had the spicy chicken with lemon sauce, broccoli, and the mushroom medley on brown rice. Definitely a good place if you're trying to eat healthy and on the cheap in Vegas.
1916	0	Whatever you do DON'T stay in the courtyard rooms no matter how cheap they are. The walls are so thin you can hear everybody's conversations and you will definitely get woken up by constant loud noise. The room is also outdated. There's also no elevators for the courtyard rooms. Pay the upgrade to stay in the tower. It's so much nicer. The Oyster Bar is the best thing here, but be prepared to stand in line and wait. There's always a lot of people waiting unless you go in the middle of the night. There's only bar seating.
316	0	If I could give this place a zero, then I would. This was the most HORRIBLE dining experience that I've ever had. It is no surprise that they continue to move their business page!  Our cousins invited us to stay with them at their fantastic timeshare and we wanted to show our appreciation by taking them to a nice dinner. Earlier that day, I passed by Pampas and a hostess in front of the restaurant offered me a coupon. It was a buy one get one free offer. I inquired about the price difference between lunch and dinner, and asked that she explain what we should expect to get based on when what time we decide to eat. She told me that the main difference is that there would be 7 meat selections for lunch and 12 meat selections for dinner. We were all excited and looking forward to our dinner. It was a Sunday night, and we were sat right away. This was the only good thing about this night, no wait for a table, but here's the rest of our infuriating debacle. Our server, Karen, approached us a few minutes after we were sat and brought over a couple of large bottles of water. The caps were already removed from the bottle so we assumed that they were trying to be creative in how they served water. We later found out that they CHARGED US FOR WATER! We did not request water to begin with. She should have informed us that there was a charge before placing it on our table. Also, as you'll see on the attached picture that the bottle states that sparkling water is served in the bottle, but it was NOT sparkling at all. I asked Karen why they charged for water that we did not ask for and she said "Nevada has the worst tap water in all of United States, and I would never drink it." Obviously, her reply did not answer my question as to why they charge for something prior to informing us of the charge. BTW, it a minimal charge, but it's the principle.  Karen informed us that our coupon required that we buy a drink, so she goes on to suggest that we buy a pitcher of some type of alcoholic drink. I asked her if the coupon required that the drink be an alcoholic drink, and her response was "Well this is Vegas!" WTH!!! This girl was so irritating. I informed her that my husband did not drink alcohol, and she gave us a look of disgust. What she doesn't know is that it was only my husband who preferred non-alcoholic drinks, and the remaining 3 people would have ordered a bunch of alcoholic drinks, but the look that she gave automatically triggered us to order only the cheapest non-alcoholic drinks (with refills). Time to eat! The salad bar was horrible. It looked as if workers do not check the area to keep it clean. Totally looked unsanitary. Karen claimed there were 40 different types of food at the salad bar, and that was a totally false statement.  The meat options were horrible!!! I was already irritated by Karen's lies and up sales, so it triggered me to keep track of the number of meat options and again ... caught them in a lie! At the most, they only had 6-7 meat options that night for dinner. We asked Karen twice and another worker once if they can bring out lamb and they kept saying it was on its way. It NEVER came out to our table and we noted that it was not ever offered to anyone else. MORE LIES AND DECIT. They were charging us dinner prices for the same lunch options. They could have simply admitted that they did not have the lamb that we requested.  STAY AWAY from this place but if you're brave enough to try it, make sure that your server is not Karen, so that you'll hopefully have a more pleasurable dining experience. Karen's level of unprofessionalism left such a poor impression.
1937	1	Be ready to WAIT for your food. They cook everything from scratch. That said everything is gigantic and amazing. I have been to hash-house a-go-go several times with family and friends in vegas and it never fails to:  a. Take a long time. b. be absolutely amazing and worth the wait.    highlights include: all of their burgers, massive omelets, and fried chicken and waffels.    i hear there is a new location on south strip but i ve only ever  gone to the one on west Sahara. good thing to do on the way to or from red rock.
1778	0	For the love of God, if you see this place....run.  My girlfriend and I were unfortunate victims of this restaurant.  Having just flown into Vegas from New York that morning, maybe we were jetlagged.  Maybe the brightly lighted fish tanks allured us.   But alas, the fates took us here and it ruined our entire evening.  We were walking around Caesar's Palace and saw advertisements.  "A noodle bar?"  It sounded quirky and interesting enough, an honestly delightful complement to all the other restaurant reservations we had made for the rest of our trip.  So we strolled in, after quickly reading a few Yelp reviews.  They weren't positive.  We had figured that perhaps some people were too harsh, and the reviews were mixed.  Well, I should have figured something was up when the person with the most check-ins for this restaurant was our hostess.   And it began.  Taking a seat, I couldn't help notice that as opposed to the normal restaurant attire of Vegas, most of the other patrons were wearing t-shirts, shorts, and swim trunks.  At 7 pm at night.  I shrugged it off, and looked towards my girlfriend who was trying to piece together the atmosphere as it was her first time in Vegas.  We trucked on and ordered.  The food arrived 5 minutes later.  Never a good sign, I've learned.  The pork buns themselves were okay..but horribly overpriced.  Our noodle dish however, left us in such disbelief that we called over the waiter. As opposed to its 22 dollar price tag, we had gotten lo-mein made with spaghetti.  In sheer disbelief, we called over the waiter as we had felt like we were massively gutted.   We had gotten a noodle dish so terrible, I would have gladly preferred to go to the local mall, and gotten food court lo mein.    Because we're troopers, we finished the meal and reached for our check.  Still hungry, we noticed that the price tag of the meal was 50 dollars.   For a small dish of what was lo mein, badly cooked chicken, and pork buns that practically defined mediocre.  It may have ruined our evening, but don't let it ruin yours.  Please avoid this place, and find any other establishment.  ANY OTHER PLACE.  This is a waste of your time, money, and honestly, is a blackmark on a pretty great hotel.   But hey, at least they have pretty fish.
1989	0	I came here for a friend and I's birthday from Atlanta.... We were treated horribly. Our entire Las Vegas experience has been phenomenal until this. I am a lifestyle blogger and this will def be on my list of things NOT to do. The club is beautiful I wish the security would have been as great. One of the guards actually put his hands on one of my friends..... I was yelled at like I was a man  for not understanding which way to go..... Security guard got directly in my face to the point he spit on me.   I have never had this bad of an experience in ANY club in any city. I suppose they could care less about people having a great experience since they bring in so many patrons. The guest celebrity host Lebron James, I'm sure would have been floored if he knew how badly people were treated.   We should have listened to locals  when they told us not to come here. Better luck tonight!  Naeemah Jade
307	1	Maybe I'm a sucker for French bistros, but I loved Bouchon. The cocktails are delicious, the wine list varied and the French fare perfectly French and delectable, all at reasonable prices. And though having nothing to do with the food/service, I love their business card letterpress!
638	1	My wife and I wanted to have our anniversary dinner at GR Steak and let me tell you... it was fantastic! We were brought in on schedule at 6:30. We were given some interesting details about decor as we were taken to our table. Unfortunately the table was in a dark corner on the first floor with a wall for my view. I politely asked if we could get another table and our request was granted without hesitation... a table at the bottom of the stairs with a perfect view of the action. Our waiter Alex was excellent... answering every question we had and not making us feel rushed. We ordered wine and the chorizo stuffed lobster tail for an app and it was outstanding! Next we ordered our entrees... the rib cap for me and the infamous beef wellington for my wife. The rib cap was amazing as well as the wellington... melts in your mouth. My wife and I got the asparagus and mac and cheese for sides respectively... and let me tell you it was the best mac and cheese Ive ever had! Then it gets better... dessert is sticky toffee pudding... omg... I have never tasted any dessert that can even come close to the synergy of flavors that Chef Ramsay gave me. All I can say is Chef Ramsay delivers on all levels... from the food... to the service... to the atmosphere... this is an experience that you will never forget!... ever!
1892	0	This place is alright. I've been wanting to try it just because it's Serendipity and I haven't been to any of the other ones. I didn't have time to wait in line and eat there so my friends just went for the window instead.  My boyfriend and I shared a Cappuchino Frozen Hot Chocolate and one of the dogs. I think it was the regular one. New York Dog? Not sure.   The dog was just that. Just a hot dog. Nothing special.   I hardly noticed any cappuchino flavor in the frozen hot chocolate. I expected it to be more fabulous.  The only thing that really caught my eye here was the fact that they give you Total Rewards points for buying here. And that its plastic utensils are so shiny that they look like real silverware! lol
1680	0	I've alway wanted to try this since my friend told me about it ever since it opened. She recommend me the hot frozen sundae. She said its supposed to be hot but it's cold because of the ice cream and the hot chocolate. She couldn't really describe it to me until I try it.   So now I took my friend here since it was her birthday. Our service was nice but I could have better service at Ihop. We ordered just the appetizers and the hot frozen sundae. Few minutes later he gave us our desserts before our food came. We ask him we wanted the desserts last after our meal. So he took it back. The place wasn't busy as I thought it would be. When our meal came. The nachos and the onion ring was good. As I said I could have better. When we were done with the meal, our desserts came and when we tried it. It wasn't hot as they describe it to be. It was very disappointment. After it was recommend. I won't wanna go back here again.
1990	0	I have never experienced such rude mean service from the security staff. I was there for a bachelorette party this past weekend and holy sht it was beyond packed I'm surprised that the fire department didn't shut this place down. Thankfully we had reserved a table and purchased bottle service everything about the bottle service was fine up until all decided to go downstairs and dance, did I mention how crowded it was.  As we were walking downstairs I was pushed into one of guard the  A$$wipe takes me by the arm and slams me against the wall and starts pulling me thru this maze of a back room. After witnessing how they beat up on some guys I was horrified that they would do the same with me, eventually they asked the meat head that took me back there what i had done and the he said I had given him lip and pushed him, really??? it was an accident I didn't push you I said, after apologizing for something that I didn't do they let me return to the party. I got my stuff and LEFT I was not going to spend any more time there.  The next day I woke up with bruises on my arms and on my legs. I would not recommend this place to anyone it's not worth it this place is way too crowded. I was told that they also took the person who was walking behind me and that they punched him twice.  The only reason why I didn't call the cops was because I didn't want to be the one to ruin the party.
1097	1	It's no secret that I'm not really a fan of pizza but once I tried the ones here... Oooooohhhh man... I'm in love! Every bite tastes like heaven. I had the cheese w/ mushroom pizza and my belly was dancing in joy! My husband and I loved it so much that we purposely forgot our diet and went for another round!
1928	1	A Vegas staple.  I've been here about 30 times, the galbi is best because they remove it from the bone. This is the best Korean bbq you will find...if you are looking to get a tattoo and your nails done on either side of the location.  I like the constant stream of K-pop and gangsta rap.  Get the Korean galbi and don't forget the enoki mushrooms.
528	0	Eek.   Went to this buffet two days in a row during a trip in Vegas. It drips with mediocrity. You'll notice they have SO MANY choices but none of them are executed well.  This buffet leaves you with a full belly but little satisfaction.  The mini donuts were fab. 2 stars.
1774	1	I am in love.  Nutella!  Amazing coffee!  Wish that they would expand their menu of sweet crepes!  Go to the restaurant (up the elevators).  It is cheaper than the "to go" stand in the casino.  I ordered my food to go a couple of times from the restaurant without a problem.  Yum!
373	0	I stayed here last month and this hotel is definitely a "you get what you pay for" hotel.  It's very small compared to the gigantors surrounding it. You can stand at one end of the casino and see the other end very clearly.  Their giftshop by the entrance seemed to never be open.  The room I stayed in had one power outlet and it wasn't by the desk.  The bathroom door didn't fit through the door frame for some reason so it wasn't able to shut.  The air conditioner didn't work but I didn't mind.    I gave a star for the room service ladies and gents.  They were always greeting me and offered towels galore.  The second star is for their mini 24/hr convenience store located by the elevators and pool entrance.  Everything you need is in there.    Speaking of the pool, it doesn't look like what it does in some of the yelp photos.  I think they renovated it and now it's just two pools. The waterfall and two "mini" pools are gone.   Overall, if you're on a budget and want to splurge on other things and just need a place to sleep, this is it.
900	1	Damn good burgers. I had the truffle burger and it was top notch -- cooked perfectly, well- seasoned, and juicy. Expect to wait in line. Also, I highly recommend sharing the fries as you're paying 8-12 for them but they're large enough to share between 3 people.
1902	0	Would not come back to this buffet again. When deciding to eat at this buffet, we figured that it would more or less be on par with other casino buffets around the same price. I really do not think that's the case anymore. The dinner wait time alone lasted for over an hour, and even the sheer hunger that derives from standing in line couldn't make the food taste much better.
1311	1	First time having a Croque Madame so don't have anything to compare it too but it was delicious! The bread used is so dang tasty!  Also, they forgot to bring us bread so we dipped the fries in the jelly they brought us and it was a very delicious combo- sweet and salty. Mmmm  The Brioche was a little too rich and sweet for our taste but it didn't prevent us from cleaning our plates :)
286	0	I went here so that I could talk crap about the waiter, but he wasn't even mean!  He just basically ignored us.  I wanted to get into verbal disagreements with someone.  -1 for crappy ribs -1 for no plate -1 for long wait -1 for no paper hat -1 for being expensive  Never coming back here ever again unless its free.
106	0	DISGUSTING!  After waiting for an hour, we finally arrived near the end of the line where I can grab my strawberry soda. After paying my cheap admission price of ~$12, I was eager to start my dinner with hopes it would be decent given all the hype.   10 minutes later, I ate raw canned corn which were half cooked, a piece of steak that was rock solid when suppose to be medium rare, chow mein which tastes far from even mein, and lukewarm broccoli. It made me really appreciate the other bad buffets I have been too. This is by far the worst buffet I have been to.   The floor was grossly dirty. Pieces of bread and meat lingered all over. Parents were letting their kids roam free, dropping ice cream and strawberries. I even saw a kid pick his booger out before using the same hand to grab a corn on the cob. Needless to say, I lost my hungry appetite FAST.   The salad bar was not any better. The lettuce was not in cold temperature. The dessert section was mediocre with plain peach cobblers. Not worth the drive. Now worth the wait. Not worth the price. Just not worth it at all.
104	0	OK I have as good of a sense of humor as the next guy. Probably better. But this place just plain rubbed me the wrong way.   I understand the premise of the place, staff treating you like garbage and you're supposed to laugh it off as part of the charm, but for real, you gotta draw a fuckin line somewhere.  My story: A friend and I came here to grab a drink and we see a bunch of people wearin these weird paper hats with things like "asshole" and other insulting shit like that written on them. I won't write what some of 'em say because they were just plain gross (especially for a place that serves food), again, understand where the line is.   So I start talking to one of the bartender chicks and she tells me the hats are insults that they label individually and, in one of the most twisted compliments (may have been a pass, I really don't fuckin know or care to know for that matter) I've ever had heaved at me in my life. She says to me "like if I was to make a hat for you it would say 'You're not worth the AIDS I'll get," I really couldn't believe she had the gall to say that, but I managed to maintain my cool and dish it right back to her saying "right on, so if I was gonna make one for you it'd say 'titties in progress' right?" then just turned around and walked away.   I'm not HIV positive or have AIDS but can you fucking imagine, if I did, the lawsuit I could file against this place?!?!? Also if I did, that would just not be in the most poorest of tastes to say. Even for a place like this.  Anyways the moral of the story is, know when to draw a line if you're gonna run this type of joint because it's a pretty slippery fuckin slope and shit could get real bad throwing words like that around.
574	1	WOW. I can safely say we ordered everything on the menu and ATE EVERYTHING! Our favorites were the sukiyaki beef noodles, original bibimbap, spicy pork, squash tempura, and the free side of tofu. Amazing value, and this review got me a free macaroon dessert!
1616	0	I've been to Serendipity 3 in NYC and this for me was a disappointment.  The restaurant was too busy and the wait too long, so we got take-out. The Frozen Hot Chocolate was Ridiculously expensive for what it was- served in a lame plastic cup. It also took Forever for them to complete our  orders. *lame* and overrated
1731	0	Not a fan went in for a quick $60 snack ! This place is not cheap portions are small. I wanted dim sum but they all had pork. I asked if there was one without pork and the guy told me beef. I ordered the vegetable dumplings that came out really bland and wet. They gave me soy sauce I asked if he had anything spicy to mix in brought out a sauce and charged me $2. I also had to ask three times for the sauce and I was sitting right at the bar stool infront of the guy. I would pass on this place definitely not worth it. The soup was also pretty bland.
97	0	While the entire buffet scene in Vegas have gone downhill over last few years, this one is especially BAD.    I came here to try their Sunday "Gourmet" Brunch.  Its 32.95+ tax but the it was a huge disappointment!  In Short, don't waste your money to come here.  The line was non existent when I came.  I felt it was not a good sign.  The foods were quite mediocre.  They have alot cutbacks for their brunch.  King Crabs are gone, snow crabs instead (Like Wynn).  FYI, King Crab only available on weekend dinner so I have been told. The quality of the crab is....crap.  Soggy and soft.  Lack of flavors.  Rest of the foods were non remarkable.  The presentations weren't good so did the taste of food.   Dry steaks, dry salads. Horrible Asian stations and their Italian station didn't look too good either.  Their desserts are one of their best tasting station to save this review from having 1* only.  I like their cheese cakes and apple pie but rest of them are just ...blah.  Save of your money and go somewhere else.  If you are on comp.  Try to venture other a la carte dining options in this hotel or other MGM properties.
792	0	Came here for lunch. It's around $20/person. After taxes my family of 3 paid almost $70 and it was definitely not worth it. There was barely anything appetizing to eat, the variety is very limited. There is a lot of bread, a lot of cold salad, a small asian and italian station (very limited and unappealing). The food is not that hot and the taste was meh. The dessert and drinks section is decent. The staff is very attentive to clearing your dishes- which is the only reason why I gave this 2 rating instead of 1. I noticed a lot of other people left very quickly. Anyways it's so expensive and not worth it, trust me! At the very least go in and take a look before you pay.
963	0	Horrible food, worst buffet ever. hire new cook s or update your menus w/better tasteful food. quality is poor but quantity is enormous. wanted to contribute rev to the hotel stays restaurants but i would never come here again at @$22+/pop for lunchtime.. do not waste your money, walk across the street for something better, you are in the strip.
1234	1	I love it here. Expensive but worth it. Service is awesome and quality is amazing. They even gave us ice cream macarons which are heavenly. I would definitely come back and tell all my friends. I was really happy when i left because it was a great experience for us!
1675	1	Wow.  I can't say enough about this place.  The prices for good food on the strip are relatively steep, but the prices here were downright reasonable.  And the food was great.  The wait staff bent over backwards for me, and quite frankly, I ate most of my meals here over 5 days.  How could I do that?  The menu is HUGE, man!  I would strongly recommend this restaurant.
667	1	My friend recommended coming to this place, and I'm so glad I did! Probably the best Thai food I have ever had. This place is huge, and I can see why! The place immediately became packed as soon as it opened. We had Thai tea, the catfish Po Tek (?) soup, Shrimp Pad Thai, and the famous Garlic Chili Prawns. The Prawns were like $30? But soooo worth it. They were huge and full of flavor! Too bad I'm from Houston; I miss this place already.
1117	1	Wow!! Best burger I have had in such a long time! I got the Gordon Ramsay burger and onion rings. The burger had duck bacon which was a little like turkey bacon but better. The flavors here just blend so well together. The service is fast and the waiters were so polite and helpful about the menu questions we had.  I love this place! I always try to stop by here when I am in town!
1621	1	Great authentic tasting New York pizza on the strip! Okay this place is not on the Cosmopolitan's directory or list of restaurants but it definitely is sought after especially during the wee hours and after a night filled of alcohol and dancing. As it is a "secret" pizza place and not listed on the directory you gotta know someone or look here on yelp to find it (it's near estiatorio milos). Just follow the line of people out the hall. They have tons of options and all are good. Yes it's a bit pricey for a pizza place ($11 for two slices) but it's on the strip and available late night and did I mention it's good? You can even call ahead for your order. A must is their white pizza!
484	0	One of the worst ever had. I'm a local and brought my adult children to see Chris Angel. Have tried several in the same price range and was very disappointed with Luxor's buffet. I think management should eat there and I'm sure it would change. What a let down for a strip buffet. Will spend the extra $$ and go to Bellagio next time.
917	1	[edit-- after subsequent trips back to this place and realizing that the cravings for bachi burger are never ending, I have bumped the rating from a 4 up to a 5. This place is one of a kind.]  This is not your typical burger. If you are craving a cut and dry, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles on a salted angus patty with a slice of American cheese, go elsewhere. If you are a little more open minded and crave the satisfying structure of a burger with a new and unique spin, come on down to Bachi burger.  The wait wasn't too long for the two of us. My girlfriend ordered the Kiki burger and I the Kalbi burger. We shared some parmesean truffle fries which were ultra tasty and came with a sun dried tomato aioli sauce that was perhaps one of the finest sauces I have ever tasted. They were cut thin like average fries but far from average in taste and quality. The burgers themselves arrived 15-20 minutes after ordering and were cooked medium rare as requested. The kiki burger featured sweet caramelized onions and three different kinds of asian mushrooms. My Kalbi burger came with a sweet korean bbq marinade, green onions and enough kimchi to give it a noticeable kick. It was blissful. The meat was juicy and plentiful, the marinade was not excessive or overpowering (although it did drip all over my hands and face) and the balance of the sweet with the spicy kimchi simply turned out to be a winning combination. I'm a man with a respectable appetite and upon finishing the burger and fries was thoroughly stuffed. I had the green tea to drink on the side.  We didn't try deserts or appetizers but we'll definitely be making a trip back here to see what other goodies this place has to offer. The bottom line is that Bachi burger offers a unique, Asian spin on the classic American burger with delicious results. The staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable for a burger that is anything but fast food in quality. Burger fans and foodies alike-- you simply have to try it.
657	1	YES. YES. YES.  I love everything about Holstein's.  Their food is SO GOOD - get the Asian pork belly - OMG.  The milkshakes look amazing but I haven't tried them yet as I'm usually hitting up Marquee later that night and need to save some room for liquor.    Ambiance is great.  The decor is hilarious and cool at the same time - like butcher shop meets harajuku lovers?  And they have a great DJ that plays after 10 (love that they're open super late!)  I will continue to come here every time I'm in Vegas, and you probably should too.
265	0	NOT A HILTON ANYMORE ! Do not stay at this property. They have been kicked out of the Hilton Brand for poor performance. I had such a bad experience at this hotel that I have been keeping an eye on it. If you call the Honors Desk they will explain the situation. They deserve it too. Save your money and go stay somewhere else or you will be sorry. It is nice to see that Hilton corporate cares about its brand and gave this dump the axe. Thank you Hilton Corporate.
1099	0	MGM is ok I guess and navigating throughout the casino could have been thought out a lot better. In my opinion placing the floor map of the casino could have been in a better location such as when you first come in after parking your car, you have to find the map buried within the casino. Also they have a horrible potpourri smell in the lobby area and beyond. I'd advise if you have breathing issues or not really a custom to a very heavy fragrant to plant type materials I would try and avoid this area as much as you can, especially kids with breathing health issues.
1123	0	Okay, first of all. If you are going to charge that much money, you better try a little bit harder to make the food taste good. Almost $20 per person!!! They take advantage of the fact that they are on the strip and just charge extra for it. Maybe if they made better food it wouldn't be much a big deal for $20. The food was so bad that we were still hungry after we left because we couldn't finish it. Save yourselves the trouble (and money) and go somewhere else.
534	1	Las Vegas' worst kept secret!  In a sea of overpriced food and tiny portions, it's nice to have a cheaper alternative that still tastes good! It's hard to beat $5/slice on the strip! $22 for the whole pie!  You can find this pizza place inside The Cosmopolitan. There is no sign. There is no name. Just a hallway leading to a small room that serves some damn good pizza!  This place really honors the New York style pizza. Thin crust at its finest! I usually don't like eating the crust at the end, but I couldn't get enough of it! There's just enough crust, but their crust is so flavorful. I could eat just a whole pie of that crust!  Their white pizza is the best!! Three different kinds of cheese with no red sauce. Sooooo good! It's like the best cheesy bread you'll ever have! I love the dollops of fresh ricotta that's on it. Their red sauce options are pretty good also, but the white pizza is the best!  By the way, they're open ridiculously late! Totally awesome after a night of drinking at the club! Unfortunately, I didn't find out about this place until the last day of my trip, so I didn't get to taste how freakishly awesome their pizza must taste while drunk.   There's a line here during peak hours! But the wait is toooootally worth it!
1573	0	Nothing more than an attempt at a fancy diner with the outcome of failure.  1. Overpriced for what you get.  $14 for a sandwich and fries. Should've been half the price.  2. Below average food. I got an angus steak melt on rye with sauteed onions and swiss that came with a side of fries . I asked for medium well, and it was pink. The whole sandwich was bland. No flavors at all. The onions were bland. The meat was bland. The fries tasted like McDonald's or Dairy Queen's.  Go to Spice Market Buffet if you want good food at PH.
1950	1	Took my best friend here for her pre birthday celebration! We absolutely were addicted to the popcorn appetizer! Whatever they put on it was like popcorn crack and just had a really great punch to it. It definitely was a cheddar mixed with some type of spice we just couldn't put our fingers on it lol   However, we ordered the buffalo wings....super juicy wings with a great buffalo sauce. I'm not typically a buffalo gal but this sauce was on point!My bestie got a chicken burger which she said was not too dry which made her happy, the boy toy got a classic burger and I got a rising sun! The patty was cooked to perfection and was incredibly juicy! The sweet potato fries were just perfect as well. Overall, the food was actually pretty good I have no clue if we went at a good time or what bit everything was cooked to perfection!   I wanted to try a shake but just couldn't do it. I was wayyyyyyy too full, but the popcorn.....yum yum in the tum tum!!! :) Will be back again this time to try a shake with the buns! LOL
1427	1	We went to this eating place on the recommendation of a friend.  The portions are HUGE and very tasty.  It is like country cooking in the city - great biscuits, mashed potatoes, chicken and meatloaf.  We didn't have a chance to eat breakfast, but we will definitely go back the next time we are in town.
592	1	Came here on the hype.  Definitely a good choice for breakfast.  Portions were massive!!!! Went with the chicken and waffles. It was delicious. Fried chicken and bacon filled waffles with fried leek.  I also tried Andy's sage chicken eggs benedict. It had a nice flavor to it. Service was good too.  They were friendly and catering. I do recommend this spot.
751	1	I love breakfast food, especially pancakes and omelets.  So when a friend recommended trying this place, I was down to give it a try.  I had high expectations and I wasn't disappointed!  I like how they give you a carafe of coffee when you order a cup (like IHOP) so you don't have to constantly wait to get refilled.  Since I usually drink 3-5 cups every morning, this was a plus.  As far as the food, it also met my expectations.  I decided to try the egg-ceptional omelet (has bacon, mushrooms, ham, peppers, onions and sour cream) and not only was it delicious, it was more than enough food to last me through lunch.  I wanted to try the pancakes as well but I couldn't get it as a side so i tried the banana nut muffin that other reviewers had recommended - it was good but not great, but I'm not a big fan of banana nut in the first place so others may enjoy it, i don't know.    The overall price was reasonable and I prefer quality over quantity and other than a handful of a few breakfast places on the strip the Egg and I is one of the best breakfast places around Vegas.  Highly recommended!
901	0	After a very long flight it was suggested we check out Citizens for a late dinner. We asked to be seated inside because the band playing in the bar outside was SO loud. It didn't make a difference. Our server greeted  us quickly and was very enthusiastic. We ordered the fish & chips and the tuna melt plus waters. Food presentation was beautiful.  unfortunately the fish was over cooked and the potato salad, al though made in house, lacked flavor. In the end our bill was $50 for a mediocre meal. The fish and chips was definitely over priced, $26!
1369	1	Oh cute place and so cozy for breakfast! Waited about 45 minutes as this place was packed!! Good sign right? Right and worth the wait! Had the ham and cheese omelette which was a very generous size and could be easily shared as it comes with a muffin or toast, and potatoes. Yum! My son had the chocolate chip pancakes. Need I say more? Sorry, don't remember what hubby had but I know it was good. Can't go wrong at this place. Prices reasonable considering the portion sizes are HUGE!
12	0	"You get what you pay for"  If only that were the truth.  Let's see....  We got there and: 1) The elevator from the parking structure is out - so we hoof it from the 4th floor all the way to reception with our bags in tow.    2)We got booked into a smoking room when we specifically asked for a non-smoking room  3)We got transferred to a non-smoking room (after a few hours) with a view of the Airport.... well, there would have been a view if the windows weren't so damned grimy  4)Uncomfortable Bed  5)Tube TV that kept cutting out every few minutes, which wouldn't have been bad on its own, but the batteries on the remote were dead.. HAH!  Okay, at 25 bucks a night, I might have agreed that we got what we paid for and it might have been a So-so 2.5 to three stars.  MAYBE.  But when you tack on an additional UNDISCLOSED $15/day "Resort Fee"  (What resort? it was 40 freakin Degrees out!), No Wi-Fi AND $15/day wired internet fee??  ....  Umm... Yeah ... 1.5 stars and I'm not even going to round it up to two.   PROTIP: Hooters appears to be where failed Import model wannabes with bad boob jobs go to die. - Enjoy.
1639	1	Very pleased with the high quality of the meats.  We ordered the Prime Kalbi, Korean Prime Kalbi (marinated), Beef Toro (brisket), Flat Iron Garlic steak, Bulgogi, bacon wrapped Enoki mushrooms and Jap Chae.  The meats were fresh and tender.  Brisket had very little fat for a change.  The Jap Chae glass noodles with beef is BIG and delicious.  Good value.
720	0	My friend booked this room trying to save money!  We stayed at the Riviera after checking out of The Platinum Hotel on Sunday.  No need to spend another 169 dollars.  !    *However....A WORD TO THE WISE....IF YOU GET DRUNK ON SATURDAY, MAKE SURE YOU DONT HAVE TO CHECK OUT ON SUNDAY!  IT IS THE BIGGEST HASSLE AND GETTING UP EARLY TO CHECK INTO ANOTHER HOTEL IS THE WORST! *  Moving on...  THE HOTEL:  They have kiosks to check into this place like the airports.  The front desk staff are rude but you get what you pay for.  The rooms at the Riviera are better than I expected.  The beds are comfortable.  THE BATHROOM HAS BARLEY ENOUGH ROOM TO SIT ON THE TOILET WITH THE DOOR OPEN!  If you are trying to do Vegas on a dime...stay here!  But, cab fare will be a beast!      THE CASINO:  This casino IS OLD SCHOOL!!!!  It hasn't been renovated in a long time, and it shows.  EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PLACE IS OLD AND DUSTY.  NOTHING TO SEE HERE...the best thing about this place is the 7/11 next door and it is a short walk from The Wynn and Encore.    This dude was borderline stalking and harrassing me and I almost had to report him.  He followed me downstairs and it scared me.  Luckily he stopped.  Overall:  If your funds are limitied....stay here.  Otherwise, stay somewhere else and save peace of mind.
1168	0	OMG, I thought Harrah Southern California had A bad buffet, this place was nasty. The bun was literally as hard as a rock I could not bite into it for real. Waited 10min at salad section as they have to make your salad and gave up waiting. The desserts look like they sat all day the lemon meringue pie has started to flatten on the plate. NEVER AGAIN all 4 of us agreed
1194	1	I've eaten at a lot of nice burger places in my life, living in SF (Umami Burger, Burger Bar, Roam Burger) and the burger I had at Holsteins was the best burger I've had. This is one of the best casual dining places to eat at the Cosmopolitan. It's on the second floor, across from Race Sports, China Poblano and Marquee. If you're thinking of eating at China Poblano, go here instead - it's 1/3 of the price and 3 times better.  There were a ton of creative burger options on the menu, as well as great looking milkshakes (probably equal to your entire daily caloric intake). Everyone raved about the Rising Sun burger and I've never had a Japanese twist to a burger before, nor a Kobe beef patty before. It was as good as the pictures look, and as good as everyone raves about. For $17, the bun was toasty and fresh, the teriyaki glaze was not too salty or overpowering, and the meat patty was moist and delicious. I couldn't really pinpoint the exact taste of the spicy mayo and furikake, but I'm sure it just complemented every bite. The crispy yam bits and tempura avocado added the perfect crunch.   My only complaint was the burger was a little hard to eat (it was super tall), and hard to get a little of everything in each bite, but nothing that would prevent me from ordering this again and again.  I paid $2 extra for onion rings which were perfectly fried, crispy, and fresh.  Each bite was perfection - my mouth is salivating thinking about this meal. I haven't eaten a lot of burgers in Las Vegas, but I don't need to try any other places - I'll just keep coming back here to repeat this burger and new ones.
1725	0	Very smoky and stinky hotel. On a cold winter day and walking in. OMG. well they have the heat on high which means that when you walk in the smoky smell and stuffiness don't go well. Its a bit disgusting. I personally can't stand this. I say air circulation should be a concern.
1058	0	Food quality: 1.5 out of 5 Price: 1 out of 5 Ambiance: 4 out of 5 Service: 1 out of 5  Highlights: Overpriced, mediocre Chinese food with bad service. You are better off going to Panda Express at the mall.  * * *   Okay. Let's preface this with the fact that I am an Asian American raised in a part of California where good Chinese restaurants can be found in unusually high concentrations. I'm used to my wonton noodle soups costing somewhere from $6 to $12, with excellent quality. I'm also used to service being spotty at Asian restaurants, so that isn't really unexpected.   My girlfriend and I came in for lunch, craving some tasty hot noodle soup. We sat down and got the beef brisket noodle soup and the pork wonton with chicken broth noodle soup. The Total Rewards pricing for each was $15.99. (Side note: Everyone should get Total Rewards pricing since it's free to get a card from the casino and works at half of the casinos on the strip.)  The price was already a little over the top from what I would pay for great noodle soup. But our craving was strong, and we knew our options were limited.   Sat down. Waited several minutes before anyone acknowledged us. Finally got our order in. Only took about 5 minutes for the food to come out.   The beef brisket noodle soup was oily beef broth. Not the kind you would want to drink a bowl full of. The noodles were not bad, the beef pieces were ok. Overall, the broth really killed the bowl for me, and the fact that it was a $16 bowl.   The pork wonton noodle soup had a lighter broth. It was definitely drinkable and tasty, but the wontons tasted really off. Like they weren't made out of pork. The noodles were the same house made ones. There was random pieces of seaweed and tiny dry shrimp. A weird mix but not completely surprising from an Asian bowl.   Overall, not worth the price or even worth visiting. You are honestly better off going to Panda Express.
741	1	LOVE this place.  The promotional materials say that BurGR "takes the traditional burger, fries and milkshake comfort food combination to an entirely new level," and that's not hyperbole.  We had the Uber Cheese Burger (3 kinds of cheese, fantastic gooey goodness), the Chicken Sliders (good sized, a little aggressively spiced) and the truffle fries (huge portion, more than enough for two to split).  Nothing disappointed, and it was enough food that we didn't finish the fries, despite our best efforts.  Our servers were both terrific: Gianna, who my date described as "put-her-in-a-teacup-cute," and Alex, who knows his way around a beer list.  (On that note, the beer list here is not world-beating, but is passably broad and reasonably priced.)  The servers and host staff are decked out in form-fitting '60s-flight-attendant-inspired uniforms, which is a nice touch and good eye candy.  Easily a level above Holstein's at the Cosmo.  I'll definitely be back.
289	1	Quite possibly the best burger I've had. How many times have you ordered a burger medium rare and it comes out pretty much well done? Not here. My blackjack burger (ciabatta bread/jack cheese) was THICK and cooked perfectly, a little crispy on the outside and very JUICY on the inside. Even the included skinny fries were pretty good. At $14 it was totally worth it. I also had a twinkie milkshake (great idea). It tasted great, but probably not worth it for $9.
376	0	We tried it for breakfast since we were staying at the hotel and had a two-for-one coupon. If you're in that same situation, there are worse places you could go, but if you're contemplating paying full price, don't.    If you're in Vegas to enjoy gambling and shows, this might be a convenient option to fill up. If delicious food is on your "must" list, keep looking.
1520	0	Awh. My meal here was $27 and I got a hamburger and fries and a pop.  My friend and I could not agree on a place to eat, and by this time on our trip, tensions were running high between us. We compromised on I  Burgers. This was in the Palazzo, where we were doing some high end shopping and browsing.  I eat hamburger and fries a lot, and I was unimpressed by this high end place. I love going out to eat at nice places and am willing to spend the money, but this to me was not better quality than a Mcdonalds. (Which I hate) I wouldn't come here again. I understand that it is in the Palazzo, but I still don't see why the prices were so high.  It was just a hamburger and fries to me, but my friend did get a nice Tshirt here that brightened up the journey.
303	1	Dear god, we have found heaven.  After (yet another) heavy night of drinking, I dragged my ladies out of bed after 2 hours of sleep so that would could get Easter Brunch at Bouchon. They were not pleased...until they tried the food. Then they knew it was worth it.  The ambiance made you feel like you were abroad. Really. The host was helpful and seated us a bit early for our rez. Our waiter (my only compliant about this place) was actually kinda an ass. We ordered 3 entrees but my friend also wanted an order of the doughnuts and he kept "correcting" her that she wanted 2 orders...when in fact she kept telling him she wanted 1. Really odd and unnecessary.  Anyway moving on TO THE FOOD. The bouchon bread pudding french toast was out of this world! Tasted like bread pudding meets apple pie. The beignets were the best I've ever had! Warm and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Their omelettes were also tasty and fresh.   Will be returning here shorty for another fabulous brunch!
906	1	Lotus of Siam definitely lives up to it's reputation. I love Thai food and I've been to several Thai restaurants around the country and this is easily the best Thai food I've ever had. Not only is the food here amazing but the prices are very reasonable.   My dad and I both had an amazing meal here. We ordered the Nam Ko Tod to start and it was a great start to the meal. It was a great play on sour, salty, spicy, and crunchy texture. Next I ordered the Khao Soi and my dad ordered the Soft Shell Crab Drunken Noodles. Both were phenomenal dishes. We also shared a side of the spicy pork fried rice, which couldn't have been any better. And last but not least we shared the sticky rice with mango and coconut ice cream. This is a must have and was one of the best deserts I've had in a while. It was the perfect way to end the meal, it's very refreshing and not too heavy and not too sweet, a great way to cool down your mouth after a spicy meal.
36	0	I really was expecting more from this. My mac and cheese was kinda bleh. I figured a place that was known for hot chocolate...er frozen, whatever...would have comfort food down pat. Getting seated was kind of a nightmare, and the atmosphere was too bright and crowded for my taste.   I would have tried it again, but several months later I found Max Brenner, which was everything I wanted Serendipity to be.
1881	0	Customer Service here is awful! The servers literally stood around together talking and laughing and completely ignored their tables. Also they look for every opportunity to upsell you, and when you are not interested in taking a picture that they practically force you to buy they are super rude.   This place is super overpriced for what you get here. The chicken salad was just iceburg lettuce with a little chicken on top/nothing special.   I wouldn't recommend senior frogs if you are looking for good food at a good price!
415	1	Every trip to Vegas, it is a MUST for us to stop here and eat! This place is AMAZING, everything on the menu is worth trying....  Now, the service.... if I could offer Carol Anne 20 stars, I WOULD! She is super sweet, always with a smile. We are a large family....11 of us!!! Some waiters/waitresses don't like or fear a large crowd...but she took us all with the biggest smile ever!!!!  it's service like that, that makes this delicious experience....PERFECT!!!
1224	0	If u want to eat at a place similar to Dennys, but over priced?? Come to this place...  Wasn't satisfied with my food, nor my coffee...   Is a traditional American breakfast with a fancy name... Nothing else I can say about this place... not worth it...
1344	1	Bouchon was out of control.   This was a highlight of our honeymoon. I was so looking forward to this meal and knew after we got here, nothing would compare. And we were right.   We were sitting next to a lovely couple who highly recommended the chicken and waffles and what a recommendation it was.   Let's just say the bread and butter course was the best I've ever had.   We started with the basket of pastries. We had the raspberry beignets. Full of freshly prepared raspberry jam with a crispy exterior. The chocolate almond croissant was incredible. The pecan sticky bun was topped with so many pecans! But my favorite of all was the cheese pastry. It was a muffin full of mascarpone cheese and it was heavenly.   For our entrees we split the eggs Benedict which was good but I could have done without. The chicken and waffles was the star of the show. Bacon cheddar waffles with perfectly roasted chicken with mushroom bacon gravy poured on top. Like, are you kidding?! It was perfect. The side of fries and bacon were also exceptional.   We mentioned that we were on our honeymoon and were sent a delicious creme brulee on the house that was, of course, perfect.   Everything was amazing. Between service, food, and value this place is not to be missed.
632	1	Awesome, especially during happy hour! Best value meats (everything $4 and under) and unlimited banchan.   We really liked the bulgogi and pork belly. It was the first time I've tried chicken cheese fondue and that was great too.   Would definitely come here again. It's off the strip but right next to the Hard Rock and such great value.
680	1	I grew up in Montana. I know a good burger when I sink my teeth into it. Imagine my surprise when the best burger I've ever had the opportunity to experience (at a restaurant,) came from Vegas.  The kobe beef burger is worth every penny. The service is great, Sin City beer is good. There can be a bit of a wait, depending on when you get there, but it's worth it.  Doesn't quite compare to the fresh burgers my dad used to make, but it comes damn close.  If you love burgers, you have to check out the Burger Bar.
1302	0	We expected the menu to be a fusion of flavors but really it was just a restaurant offering two different menus in one. Portions were small, food was severely over priced and they served their sodas per bottle. The food quality wasn't good. The shining star was their salsa and chips. The salsa is great, but do yourself a favor and take it to go and pair it with food from somewhere else. The staff is moving your plates and grabbing plates to clear the table while your still eating, but the actual server who takes your order was MIA we had to ask someone to get him for us. It makes enjoying a dinner with your friends and family hard. Get the chips and salsa to go but don't stay and eat.
979	0	My husband and I decided to play "tourist" on the Memorial Day weekend.  We started to Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops.  While walking thru the shops, we decided to share a yard margarita.  (If we wanted to play tourists, we had to look the part!)  Fat Tuesdays had a line down the hall and around the corner!  So we thought we'd see what else was in the shops.  We thought we were lucky because just as we were about to walk out of the shops, Cabo Wabo Cantina appears with a margarita/daiquiri stand.  We end up getting the  1/2 yard with a strawberry margarita.  The first couple sips, neither of us said anything.  I didn't care for the drink so I stopped drinking it.  About 2 minutes later, my husband looks at me and says "Doesn't this taste a little funny?"   Yes!  It tasted like a watered down slushie/virgin margarita!  We decided to salvage the drink...went to ABC Store, bought Bacardi's Cherry flavor and poured a couple shots in there.  It tasted much better after that.  All and all...the drink cost over $30 (between the cost of the  1/2 yard at Cabo Wabo, tip, and ABC liquor purchase).  Will we go back?  Heck NO!  I'll wait in line at Fat Tuesdays or skip the drink next time.  PS:  This struck me as very strange....Our server at Cabo Wabo was counting her tips.  And not just quickly going thru the cash and then waiting on us.  She was pretending to be interested in us while she was counting out her money.  We told her our drink order and she gave us the "deer in the headlights" look with a blank smile!  She wasn't paying attention to one word we said!  We repeated our order, she recounted her money then got us our drink.  Not sure why it was so important to count her money so intensely but it was kinda weird!
725	1	This review is based on multiple meals here over the last year. When in Vegas for business, I am always sure to stop by Bouchon, Thomas Keller's stunning French bistro. The food is precise and on the money, the atmosphere is welcoming and classy without being stuffy, and the location (in the Venezia Tower, away from the usual Vegas crowds) is perfect.   The onion soup is, hands down, the best in the United States. Rich, creamy even, the essence of a few ingredients. The steak frites, while basic as a dish, is exactly how it should be served (with the fries taking the title as top notch). The rotisserie chicken is juicy and flavorful - the mark of true experts. The cold seafood platters (oysters, mussels, etc) is sourced from Keller's high end French Laundry purveyors - screaming fresh.   There are a lot of celebrity chef restaurants in Vegas that trade on their famous name. This one trades on the quality of the food. A must-visit.
34	0	Horrible.  The food was so chewy and uneatable and the service was so bad.    I mean, our waiter was nice when she was at our table, but she wasn't at the table to often.   We had to always call for her, she would say "yes I'll be right there" then she would walk away and not come to us.   The shrimps and muscles were very fishy and the meat was so chewy like gum.  I did not enjoy my dinner here at all.  One good thing about this place is the olives at the salad bar.  They were very yummy. I'm not the only one who was annoyed.  There was a couple at the other table for 5+ minutes and no one came and took their drink orders.  When they came up to the waitress she had told them "oh we're not serving at that table".     Why would you seat people there if you aren't serving at that table? And mind you, the servers passed by this couple multiple times and didn't tell them anything.  Eventually they moved the couple to a different table.   Anyways, to conclude my thoughts, I will not come here again. Horrible first experience.
1625	0	I've been to Vegas a number of times and have never done buffets before. This time, I went to two. I was most excited about MGM's buffet because I'd heard so much about it, and I'm a fan of crab legs. I was so disappointed. The crab legs had to have been the smallest, most malnourished little babies I have ever seen. They were not flash cooked to help the meat pull away from the shells, so getting into them was almost impossible. While there is a large selection of food, I was not impressed with the overall quality. I wanted so badly to love this buffet because I wanted to make it part of my Vegas excursion every year, but this one just doesn't stack up for me. I think it is overpriced (about $40 per person) for what you get, especially given that buffets are in abundant supply in Vegas. So, I'm scratching MGM off of my list, but I'm glad I tried it.
1425	0	It's either a one or a two, I'll be generous and give it a two.   My first and only time in this place was to celebrate mine and my BF's birthday, we were staying at the Monte Carlo so it made perfect sense to go downstairs here. We ordered a shot, and Miss Bartender told us that she can not make any shots, all she can do for us is a shot of Patron.  NOW wait a minute, you're a bartender?   We settled for it, paid $12 for each shot and walked out. HOrrible service from this lady, needless to say I will not be coming back.   It was also very stuffy in there. I did like the dimmed lights.
766	1	First time trying Korean BBQ and we were very impressed and satisfied. It was about a 30 minute wait, but very worth it! It was more food than we expected so better come hungry! We got the Gangman package for 2 and we could not finish it all. It was all very delicious! We will definitely return next time we come to Vegas!
1170	1	So glad I don't have to fly to New York just for shake shack. Although I love my In-N-Out, I have to admit that Shake Shake wins the West Coast vs East Coast rivalry. Shake Shack is now my favorite fast food restaurant. The Shack Stack is a complete mouthgasm. The double double from In-N-Out has the better sauce, but the giant fried portobello mushroom with cheese from the Shack Stack is unbeatable. The fries here are crinkled-cut, usually not my favorite, but they're actually well seasoned and crispy. I definitely prefer them over Animal style fries. I need to come back and try their milkshakes.
392	0	I booked this hotel room hoping for a "4 star experience" in Las Vegas. When we arrived in the room, it smelled like mold and smoke (even though it was categorized as NON smoking), the carpet was dirty, and the hotel receptionist wont move our rooms unless we paid an extra 40 dollars per night to "upgrade" to a newly remodelled room. Being desperate for comfort and cleanliness, I went ahead and paid the extra 80 dollars to upgrade. I am writing this letter to communicate my disappointment to hotwire's online description of the hotel. I felt mislead and deceived from the hotel description.  Moral: not all "deals" from hotwire leads to a happy ending. Blah.
1595	1	I love you, Secret Pizza.  We went on a Sunday for lunch and it was probably very different than 3am on a weekend.  We ordered Veggie, Meatball/Pepperoni, and White slices.  I can't even comment on the other two as we were just dying over the White Pizza. We ordered it because we felt like we "should" since it was supposed to be the most popular. It was amazing...a bit oily, but full of garlic and cheese. Loved it.   Probably would be even better after a late night of drinking, but a meal right before driving home was pretty good too.  Its a casual place. Sodas served in red solo cups (for $4...). The unmarked, unadvertised part of it is so fun. And if you've been to the Cosmopolitan before you'll be shocked to see where it is. We've sat there and people watched probably 2 or 3 times and never saw the hallway to the restaurant.
777	1	LOVE this place.  Not only is it in my favorite Las Vegas hotel, The Cosmopolitan - but it exhudes that feeling of farmhouse crossed with Americanized swagger.  Walking in to a big cow at the front entry - you KNOW there is going to be some serious beef/meat here.  The menu is full of extremely inviting options.... right from the start.  You sit down to popcorn out of a tin, while choosing what to drink.  How a person can NOT have a milshake is beyond me.  And no, not for dessert.. but to start :)  Whether bam boozled or regular you cannot go wrong.  Remember all bam boozled shakes you can get without the liquor mostly, for 3 bucks less.  So.... even if you don't want the alcohol OR are still drunk from the daily festivities Vegas has to offer... you MUST get a shake.  Tiramisu, Vanilla, Drunken Monkey, Birthday Cake... grasshopper... all YUM!    Next is to decide on the main.  The salads are huge.  Everything is really.  The burgers are large and so so fresh.  Meat piled high on a fresh bun... with so many tasty toppings.  The steakhouse burger is amazing... although I could stand a few less black peppercorns.  The classic burger is even an smooth choice.  If you want a mountain of meat on a bun, they have that too.  OR if you are looking for something without beef... I guess that option is also available.  I don't think there would be a bad option - and I love finding out :)  The fries are okay... the sweet potato fries are better..  You can watch TV while in there... you'll get great service... and you surely won't be disappointed.  And truly the prices aren't THAT extreme considering you're in The Cosmo on the Strip in Las Vegas!
99	1	This place is pretty good. The food is not the best, but it's good. The buffalo chicken wraps are really tasty. The chicken parm was a bit toooo breaded, but even the lunch serving is MASSIVE. The "small salads" are huge! Just on food, I'd give this place 3.5 stars. BUT! They're 24 hours which is really nice to have a place 24 hours in the hotel and the price is right! Most places in Vegas, the pricing is at a premium, but this place? It's a deal!! Ate here 2 times with a family of four and both times got out for just about $50.
215	0	Screw Planet Dailies....  My experience??? Horrible and all the people with me would really agree...  We came in really late...ok I get it but this is Vegas and there was no one else in there so there really was no need for us to wait a half an hour to get some water...that is just horrible service. Then the food took ages...Seriously a sandwhich and some ramen does not take that long to prepare...The food is mediocre at best and the service is just horrible. Perhaps it is better during the day but I wouldn't know just dont ever go after clubbing or bar hopping you will likely die of hunger and thirst before your waitress takes your drink order.  Despite the bad service we tipped well considering the time...but I will not go back.
1703	1	The best BURGER in the world.  Yes, it is $10.00 more than a double double @ in-n-out, but the quality and the thickness of the beef is superb!  They cook their burger to PERFECTION, and you'll never find another place with this quality of beef.   Not only is the beef perfect, but also their toppings.  You get to choose ANY topping you like on your burger.  I always get avocado with mozzarella and satuee portobello mushroom.  MMmmm, mummmm, mummm.  My stomach is growling just thinking about it.  On yeah, you also get to choose the type of bread you want around your burger.  I always choose ciabatta bread because it's mostly crust with little dough in side.  I'm weird, I always eat the outside of the bread, but not the inside.    Bottom line, if you're in Vegas, you gotta come here and try their burger.  I assure you with one bite, you'll be hook and will always have to come back here for another burger whenever you're in town!
1875	0	We come here every year for the past 5 years for business.  I've always eaten at this buffet because I like all the veggies and fruit.  I've tried it for breakfast and dinner and in the past has always been great.  I went there last night and it was horrible and not worth $35.00!  Selection was bland and there was an Italian station with Alfredo sauce but no noodles to put the sauce on and it wasn't because they were out if noodles they just didn't have them on the station at all.  There were stuffed Italian shells but they had cheddar cheese grated on them which looked awful.  The other items were dry and the temperature of the soup was barely warm.  Salad bar and next to nothing as far as variety.  Huge disappointment this time and I won't be going back.
42	1	Absolutely love this place!! I loved the concept of an Asian fusion and everything I ate was delicious! A little upset I came in while somewhat hungover, thanks to open bar at Senor Frogs. I didn't finish my food cause my stomach was still a little upset. BUT, it was BOMB!  Husband and I shared the fried chicken wings. I'm telling you, you'd be a fool not to order them. Best wings I've ever had!! We also shared the salt and pepper garlic fries. Again.. The best ever!!  I ordered the Miyagi-San burger with grilled onions instead of onion rings. The meat was flavored SO WELL and I loved the over easy fried egg.  My husband ordered the Kiki burger and I swear I looked down at my food, then up at his and it was gone. That good!!!
1867	1	Good food with great service! The mushroom burner is a must. Paired together with the "loaded fries" and cookies and cream shake, I couldn't ask for any other meal. Top it off with great a server with a smile, Audrie made this stop worth while. Thank you for making our visit to Shake Shack awesome!
55	1	Went in with low expectations... Thinking it would be cheesy, expensive, mediocre food and small portions.  I was blown away on all accounts. Drinks were huge, portions were generous and the food was DELICIOUS and met the standards of a fine dining institution.   The Ramsay brand did not let down!  P.S. Beef Wellington FTW
1116	0	This restaurant looked really cool from the outside.  I guess I got sucked in by all the beautiful fishes in the fish tanks.  I also thought how bad can noodles be from BeiJin?  Whua, shocker!  It was BAD!  They said they the noodles were hand-pulled.  I know how hand-pulled noodles should taste.  These were not even close.  The texture were too soft and didn't have the Q (Al Dante) they should have.  The Pork and mushroom sauce were so little, I had to add soy sauce to the noodles in order to eat it.    The order of  'Beef Pancakes' has 2 and were the size of dollar coin.    Conclusion - very small portion, very expensive, and very bad food!  Don't be enticed by the fish tanks like I did.  WALK FAR FAR AWAY from this place!  It's not even worthy of 1 star!
1631	0	first time here was a year ago. went with 2 of my friends, and we ended up going to their walk-up counter because the wait for an inside table was about an hour. we ordered small frozen hot chocolate.   i must say - i wasnt really impressed. it tasted like a chocolate shake with sprinkles. maybe its better if you go inside to order it? i dont know...  second time i met some friends in town. they were eating dinner (i didnt eat because i just ate). everything looked really good and portions were pretty decent as well.   third time we went in was a few weeks ago with my sister and some friends back home. ordered a frozen hot chocolate and a frozen white hot chocolate. i couldnt remember how big they were or how "eh" they were, but my sisters never been and we were already there. my sister ordered the frozen hot chocolate for two because her and her boyfriend were gonna share it. and it was waaaaaaaaaaay too much frozen hot chocolate! and as rich as it is, you really dont need anymore than a small.   service was alright - the cashier there was a little slow at ringing in orders/putting the tickets up on the rail. and it seemed they were short staffed or something because the girl making the drinks seemed overwhelmed the whole time we were there. agian, maybe the hype was built up so much i expected a lot?  maybe i'll come back, stick out the wait and eat inside?
771	0	I've been to Cravings Buffet a few times in the past for breakfast and never had a complaint.  This time my stay @ Mirage included a buffet,  so we tried the dinner buffet,  which I'm very sorry I did.  Worst dinner buffet I've experienced as far a food is concerned.  The roast beef was dry,  the corn beef was edible, which is the best I can say.  The other food, thumbs down.  I thought the fresh cooked pasta would be better, but it was not.  The creme brulee was more watery than it should've been.   Chocolate cake so-so.  Salad was ok, but there's no way to mess that up........ The only redeeming part of the meal was unlimited beer or wine.... Mirage really needs to improve on their buffet considering the last three I;ve visited at the MGM Grand, Bellagio & Aria were nice.
661	1	My FAVORITE Grand Lux Cafe is the one inside Palazzo.  It's open LATE and the food is amazingly good for a casual chain restaurant.  Some of my favorites:  spicy calamari salad, shrimp scampi, miso glazed salmon, and caramel chicken.  Desserts are great too - can't go wrong with a batch of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies or the beignets with 3 sauces.  It's definitely worth the money.
84	1	I'm keeping this review short since there are so many to review from.  Service - 5 stars Food - 5 stars Price - 4 stars (a bit pricey but you get what you pay for so to speak)  We were recently in Vegas celebrating my boy's bachelor party.  We came in with a party of 10 and were instantly greeted and seated.  They gave us some pistachios and bread to start with.  Try the bread with a little butter and their home made mustard.  The combo sounds kinda weird, but it's killer!  To warm the taste buds, I ordered the cream of mushroom.  It was very tasty but nothing extraordinarily different.  However, for my main course, I ordered the sirloin steak sous vide with vegetables.  Mid order, I asked the waiter if I could swap the veggiies for fries.  He said, the order comes with the veggies but that he'd bring 3 baskets of fries for our group on the house.  And as for the steak, it was vacuumed sealed to capture the juices....and it definitely tasted that way.  Juiciest Sirloin ever!  Cooked to perfection and was super tasty.
1699	0	Poor quality.  We both ordered yaki udon, one beef one chicken.  We are meat lovers and neither of us ate the meat.  The beef was gristly and the chicken wasn't fresh.  The noodles were mushy.  The hot sake was harsh!  Disappointing for the money.  Waiter was mediocre.  Wouldn't go back.
1605	0	I should have known better.  Yes, it seemed handy for the trade show (we didn't realize it was in S Hall and tried walking...big mistake in 105 degree weather) and it does have a monorail station.   We'd stayed here about 5 years ago and were given an occupied room(!). It was mortifying.  But I thought w/new owners and a re-do, it was worth trying.  Never, ever again. It wasn't very clean.  Someone had either spilled a tray from room service or thrown up outside our room. It had been hastily wiped up.  I pointed it out to one of the housekeepers but it remained for the duration of our stay.   There was literally no hot water in the morning...none.  So we had to shower/wash our hair in cold water. This was a business trip!  We needed to look decent. Not a fun way to start day.   Food choices were mediocre, at best.  The only plus is that their staff was cordial. Everything about it felt like it catered to lowest common denominator
656	1	o-m-g! When it is 2am and you are starving, this place is GOLDEN! The cheese oozing burger was to-die-for! The shakes were ahhhMaZING! It is so great to have a decent meal in vegas that will not cost you an arm and a leg and is good! I would highly recommend this place! Head over towards NYNY to find this amazing burger joint!
1934	0	My boyfriend and I needed to grab a quick bite to eat in order to hold us over until the evening, so we stopped by  Pink's Hot Dogs. I've heard of famous Pink's, so I was excited to try out their food, though nothing beats Chicago's hotdogs, so I don't know what I was thinking!   I got the Polish Pastrami Swiss Cheese Dog which sounds amazing, however, I couldn't have been more off! It had a very bland taste to it, despite everything that it came with. The hog dog itself is just OK, but the Pastrami pieces it came with were so dry, that it was almost hard to eat it. My bf had a regular hotdog which is hard to mess up, but he was also very disappointed. Besides the less than satisying taste, the prices are incredibly high as well.  It's in a great location inside of PH, which was convienant for us since we were staying across the street, however, I will not be back to Pink's. I have Earl of Sandwich bookmarked for next time, which I regret not checking out due to the stellar reviews it has on Yelp.
367	0	I had to see what the hype is all about, with the line out the door every single night since it opened up a couple of weeks ago.  Going in, I didn't think the Corral would live up to my expectations.  Coming out, I decided it didn't, and I will not be returning.  And to be honest, if I had to choose, I'd much rather take my money over to Hometown now that it will be less crowded OR starve.   We arrived five minutes to 6, and the line was already out the door.  We waited a good 20 minutes before we made it to the cash register.  We were able to take advantage of the 2 for $20 special.  The promotion starts after 4 pm, Monday thru Thursday.  The third person had to pay the regular price, eh, no big deal.  We were seated fairly quickly after we paid.    Food was just okay, maybe slightly better than HTB, but not by much.  That cotton candy machine brings a nice touch to the dessert station, but it is super sticky that I did not bother with it.  Everything else was overly sweet.    Service was just okay as well.  Our server forgot to refill my brother's soda, and she never bothered to ask if I needed refill with my water.  I think the drink station should be made accessible to make things easier for all of us.    I can't say I was too disappointed with this place as I didn't have high expectations to begin with.  So if you go in with that attitude, then you'll be alright.
1619	1	My favorite chicken and [bacon-stuffed] waffles that you should get an award for being able to finish in one sitting. Also love the meatloaf sandwich, the pot pie (it's boiling pot-sized) the ridiculous eggs benedict. Caveat: I can't believe any of the meals here are under 3,000 calories.
1524	0	I DID NOT Love "love burger" like I should have... Where to start.. Service took forever. Food was dry and boring. (Yes food was boring) nothing really stood out about this place. I was honestly looking for a nice small meal, but came across the wrong place.   Service: We were seated quickly, however we sat there looking at the wall, customers, servers talking to each other waiting to have our order taken.. Took about a good 30 minutes for us to actually make an order.  Food: I ordered the original burger. The patty was so dry I felt like I was eating cardboard. The massive amounts of ketchup did not help. I didn't even finish half of it..   Overall: There's nothing great about this place except for possibly the name... Yup..
1052	0	With all the hype back in Cali about Pink's hot dogs, it was sort of weird to see that there is absolutely no ridiculous line to get myself a Chicago dog complete with all the trimmings.  As a fellow Chicago-ian, I'd say I've had my fair share of Chicago dogs and you know a good hot dog isn't good unless you have the right condiments/toppings to go with your dog.    I thought the Vegas version of Pink's was much more weak than the original location mainly because it feels absolutely cramped inside and you'll probably feel guilty for blocking the entrance trying to decide which hot dog you want. Once my bf finished holding up the line trying to find the RIGHT combination for his hot dog, we placed our order and got it within 5 minutes.  The hot dogs were pretty average and they loaded it up with tons of toppings which is nice, but my hot dog was missing out on a ton of ingredients that defines a Chi-town dog. What happened to the onions, tomatoes, and mustard on my hot dog, Pink's!? Instead I got lettuce, relish and a pickle. I'm hoping this was some sort of mistake, nonetheless we ate our food and and went on our way.
1083	1	Everything was EGGtastic. The long wait was worth it. All of the staff are super friendly and Alexa was awesome. She was very nice and attentive. I ordered the Chicken, Mushroom and Spinach and enjoyed it very much. My boyfriend for the must-haves stuffed French toast and he thought it was great. Make sure to check-in on Yelp to get the complimentary banana nut muffin.
21	1	Im in love. The food here was so delicious. So many things to try. I recomend the sukiyaki noodles and the spicy chicken with lemon sauce. For dessert tey the honey bread. Its so fen good. A bit pricey but its worth it. The staff is so friendly, so nice. A must try if your craving korean bbq.
1448	0	Please disregard my review if you're perfectly OK with all-you-can-eat crappy food, because I know that some people are.   The service is fine, our drinks were always full, and the cashier was friendly.   I had heard so much hype about them opening in Vegas that I was honestly looking forward to trying this location out. There selection was not as big as I expected, and what really bothered us was the fact that 1/3rd of the food had NO label.   The best food I had was the steak. You see them grilling It right there and they ask how you want it done. All of the other food was pretty bland. Except the cotton candy, it's hard to have nasty cotton candy ;)
1964	0	Stayed here on Sunday July 24th. I come to Vegas quite often and I've stayed at numerous hotels on the strip including Planet Hollywood, The Venetian, Treasure Island, The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Bally's, Caesar's and some off the strip and downtown.   I expected so much more from The MGM given that they're supposed to be one of the top properties on the strip.   Of all my Vegas visits I have never experienced a more horrendous check in process. We waited over an hour to check into the hotel! The line was so long that the hotel was giving out free alcoholic drinks! It was a mess! They charge for parking now as well. If you're going to charge people all this money, the least you could do is make it more convenient for them! We were also unable to check out from the TV and waited over 20 minutes to try to check out via phone so we had to again wait in line to check out!   The hotel itself is nice, the rooms are spacious, I loved the bathrooms. The pools were very kid and adult friendly.   However, I will never stay here again because it does not seem like they have their stuff figured out when it comes to customer service.
951	0	As soon as we walked in our room, the toilet was running constantly and would not flush. We called the front desk and waited an hour and nobody answered us. We decided to head out for a bit and when we got back we called the front desk again, waited a while and someone finally answered. We asked if we could change rooms and they said no. They said they would send a repair guy to fix the toilet, they did not apologize for the inconvenience.  When we got back that night the toilet was fixed. But the next morning as i went to take a nice shower, i could hardly keep my balance because there was water stuck under the bottom of the tub lining. I slipped a couple of times and so did my boyfriend. I can only imagine how much it must be rotting under there. There were also hand towels on top of the bathroom door and shower rod that were hard as a rock... Who knows how long they were there for.  Not to mention the sleepless nights because of young kids hanging out in the hallway, smoking and drinking and yelling for hours. Will NEVER stay there again.
686	1	We went to Burgr for dinner on a Sunday evening.  There was 20 minute wait to be seated. It seems to be popular.  As a vegetarian I was not keep on a burger joint and the menu has only 1 burger for vegetarians, the Earth Burger ( portabello mushroom burger ). I am not a fan of portabello mushroom, the kitchen obliged me with a grilled cheese with veggies and their mango chutney.  It was fantastic. I would recommend that again. The staff was courteous and accomodating and so was the kitchen staff. Do give it a try, even if you are vegetarian.
208	1	The best burger I have eaten in my life at Gordon Ramsey's BurGR. Besides very simple, but quiet amazing menu, everything in this restaurant was done right, from the amazing dessert shakes to waitstaff uniforms. Simple, tastefully stylish and delicious. Gordon is not only a top chef, but a smart businessman. Thumbs up!
1049	0	We got a Voucher to the buffet, decided to use it for breakfast thinking that people can't really screw up breakfast...and I was wrong! The donut holes were dry, orange juice luke warm, are the scrambled eggs real? The only good part of the breakfast was the bacon. Thank goodness it was all paid for by a voucher.
871	0	I ALMOST gave this place 3 stars, but the wait and service was so bad I can't make myself give anything higher than a 2. The 2 stars is based on the extra delicious frozen hot chocolate (that we had a coupon for, making it free), and the hot dog that ended up tasting pretty good.   Ok, so my husband and I got to Serendipity 3 at a decently off time. Didn't look too busy, so we put our names on the list and took a seat outside. We overheard someone say that if you sit at the bar you'll get served faster and you don't have to put your name on the list, so we tried that....didn't work. There are 4 or so chairs at the bar, so there went that idea. More waiting, waited so long that we had to eat a snack bar I had in my bag....before we ate lunch! I think our wait totaled about an hour for just the 2 of us. We were seated and it took our waiter 10 minutes before he came over to greet us and take our drink orders. Found out a few of the items that were on the menu were not supposed to be on there any longer (one of the items I was going to order, figures), so my husband ordered the grilled cheese with tomato soup and I ordered the mac & cheese. Simple enough. Our free frozen hot chocolate came out in this giant sundae glass,it was amazing! So good! We were expecting a tiny glass since it was free, but this could have fed a family of 4! Our food came out 35 or so minutes later, and my mac & cheese tasted like lighter fluid! It was so gross that even thinking about it right now makes me gag a bit. My husband's grilled cheese was gross too, same lighter fluid taste. Even his soup tasted like lighter fluid! I assumed it was the way they were cooking things so we brought this to the waiter's attention. He took my food back and came back to tell us that the cooks had no idea why it tasted like that and that no one else had complained. He offered to replace my gross food with something else, so I ordered a hot dog. Figured it would be safe since it wasn't covered in whatever gross cheese they were using.   We waited for my hot dog for 30 minutes!  A HOT DOG! I'm kind of hypoglycemic so by this point I was feeling pretty weak. I started spacing out, feeling nauseated, it was all I could to stay calm. My hot dog FINALLY came and I was at that point in my 'episode' where I was super nauseated, so I took a few bites and got a to-go box, which took another 10 minutes. It was just annoying how much time we spent waiting and the food wasn't even good. I ate my hot dog an hour or so later after I was feeling better and it was pretty good. If I ever went there again i'd go straight for that and a frozen hot chocolate, that's it. And i'd get it from the to-go window, not even bother going inside. My husband is curious about this giant donut we saw in the to-go window, so we might check that out next time. Not going out of our way though.
850	0	Absolutely disgusting. After getting deathly ill about 10 minutes after eating the cold crab legs (yes, shouldn't have risked it at a buffet) I had to go lay down and was sick all night. THEN the next day I went to talk to the manager who was SO rude. He asked why I didn't say something that night.... Ummmm because I was so sick I had to bolt! And I NEVER get sick from food. He informed me all he could do was call hotel security and file a report. Complete BS. Don't go here unless you want to be sick from shitty cruise ship like food and then treated poorly.
555	1	So we ate here for the first time and had breakfast. We ate the chicken and waffles (w/ bacon inside!) and the Man vs. Food Fried Chicken Benedict. I prefered the Man vs. Food order vs. the chicken and waffles only because some of the chicken was dry. The Fried Chicken Benedict was so yummy. The chicken soaked up the sauce on the plate. There were biscuits, scrambled eggs, hashbrowns and sauce along with the chicken. Really great service! The staff really seems to love their job. Lots of locals there too. Hoping to go back for lunch and dinner too while here on vacation!
987	0	Pricey for mediocre food.  The service our group of 6 had was pretty reasonable.  My biggest gripe about this place is that you have to PAY for chips and salsa.  It's not cheap either.  In addition, we got the guacamole.  We were so excited to get a bowl full of guac only to realize the bottom of it was a bunch of crushed chips so that [as our waitress explained] you don't drag your fingers through the guac.  Uh...whatever.  All of us ordered burritos.  I got the veggie burrito although I'm not vegetarian.  It was mostly filled with sauteed onions with a bell pepper here and there.  Overall, not the biggest fan of the food.  Of course with any restaurant along the strip, it wasn't cheap ($9 for a small burrito).  I will admit the salsa and hot sauce were amazing but such a rip off.  This is a fun place to drink but when you drink you want snacks...so just expect to shell out a pretty penny or 100.  [haha?]
1558	1	This is a great pizza joint. The best pizza ever? No, my heart belongs to Metro pizza and nobody can beat Metro. But this is absolutley the best pizza on the strip. It's just kinda perfect. Cosmo is my favorite strip casino and this place is the perfect place to start the night or end the night. Be careful if you choose to end your night there...there tends to be alot of drunken club-goers...which is great for people watching...most of the girls are a mess...they're either drunk, or acting drunk, shoes are off, hair is a mess, makeup all smudged and the spanx has given up! It's small and it's located at the end of a long hallway, so if it's busy and the line extends into that long hallway and it's full of those drunkin club folks, don't be surprised if someone vomits. Now that Those Guys Pies has opened in Summerlin, I do not have to trek to the strip for this pizza. Easily the best white pizza ever--definitely can't keep this place a secret.
1171	0	I'm going to preface this review by saying that I stayed here for a few nights after receiving a special offer for a $22/night rate (plus an $18/night "resort fee" which gets you wifi--for one device--and not a whole heck of a lot else), so consider that the entire trip was done somewhat on the cheap when reading the following.  In terms of the condition of the hotel and the rooms, it's certainly not dirty or decrepit by any means, but it is aging and is overall rather bland--the owners' unwillingness to put any money into renovations is readily apparent. Look around and you'll see all kinds of remnants--there's an "M" festooning the storefront of the cubic zirconium shop, a relic from Barry Manilow's stint here. And the "Spacequest Casino" and surrounding areas, including the massive entrance to the now-defunct Star Trek Experience, have largely remained as-is, which means there is a huge inexplicably space-themed casino just off the lobby. Oh, and you can still see the enormous Star Trek insignia on the outside of the building when taking the Monorail elsewhere.  We encountered a number of niggling problems over the course of our stay. We checked in at approximately 11:30 PM on a Sunday night and were told at checkin that room service was 24 hours; indeed, even the screens in the lobby, as well as the menu in the guest directory, all seemed to confirm this. However, a phone call to room service revealed that it in fact ends at midnight. What's more, an attempt to order delivery (via the GrubHub website) resulted in a phone call from the GrubHub management telling us that they can't send delivery drivers to the LVH because (and this is a direct quote) "last time they called the cops on the driver." Apparently the hotel owners are so cheap and money-grubbing that they would rather you starve than order delivery--that, or resort to the late-night "deli" off the sports book which served little more than deep-fried crap from Sysco.  The nickel-and-diming doesn't stop there. Want to make a coffee in-room? That'll be $3.50, please. Those "complimentary" bottles of water? $4 each (though, in fairness, they only charged us $4 despite the fact that we drank about three of them each over the course of our stay). Want to use the landline with your calling card? That'll be $1. Oh, and want to use the sauna/steam room? That's $20 (per day), on top of your resort fee.  Housekeeping doesn't seem to give a crap about whether or not you're asleep. Starting at 7 AM on Monday, we heard extremely loud Spanish virtually non-stop through the wall for well over an hour as the housekeepers chatted away with each other while cleaning adjacent rooms. It wasn't exactly something you'd care to wake up to involuntarily.  As far as creature comforts go, the water pressure in the showers is ridiculously pathetic--indeed, Larry King's urine stream is likely more forceful than the dinky trickle that issued forth from the shower head. Additionally, the water valve in our bathroom wouldn't completely shut off, resulting in dripping that, while not particularly annoying, did seem wasteful. What's more, the "hot" water was really on the low side of warm; I was able to get truly hot water only on the last day of our stay.  Those are probably the main issues that we encountered. Again, I'm not going to completely pan the place--the beds are comfortable, the rooms are serviceable (especially if you can snag an upgrade), the in-room A/C is ice-cold, the elevators are fast, and the promo rates can't be beat, plus the direct connection to the monorail makes it a snap to get to the Strip. If budget is a concern, this place isn't a terrible choice if you don't mind taking a few lumps.
705	1	This is the best food I have ever eaten...  The parking lot is a bit sketchy...watch out for bums.    Service is pretty good.  If you plan to eat here on a weekend or when during the tech conventions, you will need to get a reservation.    You can't go wrong with anything on the menus.   Good selection for vegans.
142	0	I wanted to love this restaurant..., I truly did because I heard Jose Andres was the Chef owner and as a DC resident I love anything Jose Andres!! One night my girl friends got take out after a long day of partying but her sister is a foodie so the fact she said her Seafood noodle dish didn't have lobster and it's $50 and then  said her food was  not  good, I became  worried because I was really excited about eating there. So Saturday after a long day at A Cedric Gervais pool party, hungover and starving we went to eat here and the food was not good at all. It was salty it tasted like MSG and I felt sick after my meal. I wouldn't be too excited to eat here again . Sooooo Disappointed :/
625	1	Went here a month ago and then went again this past week...this place just gets better and better!  This time we ordered the American Kobe Beef burger...the meat was so tender and juicy and it made all the difference!  We also ordered the Cobb Salad which I expected to be just OK but it was EXCELLENT!  The wait staff was also super friendly/attentive which makes the experience all the better.
1482	0	The meal was terrible.  We came in with empty stomachs and left with full of regrets. Should have went on Yelp to check out the reviews!! I completely agree with these reviews.  Service took forever and the food tasted so bad.  Even their highly notable cheesy tots were nasty.  Stale, cold and no flavor.  Everything was flavorless.  Their burgers were not good.  We didn't even finish anything we ordered.
271	0	Went for the dinner buffet this time. More choices to choose from makes this a great place for groups with variety of taste buds. However, I'm still not impressed by their food. The warm crab legs are good (you have to ask the staff to heat them) but nothing to write home about. The Tandoori chicken is constantly coming out the oven so it's extremely fresh. That was the highlight of my meal!!  The prime rib is not the same quality of cut that you experience at Paris or Bellagio. It might be the way it's cooked because it is dry and au jus is a must. Some of the Asian counter foods sit out for too long that it doesn't look as appetizing.  The baked potato stand is not bad as you can customize your stuffed potato to your liking.  Desserts continue to disappoint as they don't have any warm desserts like apple pie. An occasional creme bulee pops up but otherwise it's a counter of slices of room temperature pies and cookies.
1036	1	Ate there for lunch today.  The food was so amazing!  The fried rice and sour pork appetizer was a bit spicy for my wife, but I found it delectable.  We also had the crispy duck with drunken noodles, the title speaks for itself!  Service was great, and it was not busy as we hit at the end of the lunch rush.  I'll be sure to go back next time I'm in town!
453	1	This is the place for steak, if you like beef Wellington well then eat all you can while you are here because there is nothing juicier than the Wellington here. prices are over 45 on average so prepare your budget. the atmosphere is very nice and waitresses are smoking hot, you can't go wrong here.  Update 3/20/13  Got here again, tried porterhouse 16oz and it was fantastic. Extremely tender, done medium rare as I wanted it, and also got a side of mashed potato puree which complemented the steak perfectly. Our wine enthusiast picked out a bottle of 08 Embruix, Priorat which was fairly nice though a bit spicy for me. Distilled water comes in 9$ bottles, we didn't know that when we arrived so if you don't want to pay for water just ask for ice water (they only ask if you want distilled or sparkling). Hells kitchen tasting menu is also available for a limited time, its 145$ for 5 courses and an autographed photo of Ramsay and 75$ more for wine paring on this.
1490	0	This place looked like it had potential- but it fell quite flat-as do most Mexican places on  the Strip seem to!  The wait to be seated was long- yet there were plenty of open seats. The wait staff we dealt with- while not outright rude were not overly friendly. And the food was only so-so when considering the price.  There is a much better Mexican place just down the street by the Fashion Show- I suggest them over this place.
1182	0	I have very mixed feelings about this hotel.  I booked an air+hotel deal through vegas.com which came out to under $500 for roundtrip flights from NYC and four nights at LVH, which sounded like a great deal at the time.  However, I recommend you shell out the extra money to get a hotel ON the actual strip, not "just off the strip."    The bad: First, other than the gas station across the street and convention center next door, there is absolutely NOTHING surrounding this place except shady and cheap hotels.  The walk to Encore alone is about a mile, which although doesn't seem like much, sucks because of the Las Vegas heat AND the fact that from there you still have to walk so much to get to where the life is- Venetian, Caesars, Cosmopolitan, etc.  Cabs are so expensive and the group I was with would end up caving and shelling out cab fare every night to get to and from restaurants/shops/clubs and they are not cheap!  The hotel is definitely dated and could use a bit of a facelift, but it isn't terrible.  The food in the hotel is obscenely expensive.  They had a Keurig coffee machine in the room, but it was $4 PER SMALL MEASLY CUP OF COFFEE.  Insane.  I ended up going to the cafe downstairs (called Fortuna) and paying $4.27 for a large coffee.  More bang for my buck I guess.  I'd recommend going across the street to the gas station for coffee, but I got lazy and didn't want to start sweating first thing in the morning.  The hotel also offers a go-green option where you opt out of having your room cleaned in exchange for your choice of either an $8 dining credit or $10 casino credit.  Out of the two days we did that, we got the voucher only once and when I called to complain they would not honor it saying my room "wasn't in the system" for going green, which was complete BS.  The good: The rooms were clean and a decent size.  We ate at the Benihana the first night which was good, it was a very big restaurant and the service was good.  There were always cabs outside so it was easy to get one.  There is a monorail station at the hotel too, which we did not use but what's the point when it doesn't service the strip?  We did not use the hotel pool until the last day and to my surprise it wasn't too bad.  The pool was a nice size and the bar had a 2-for-1 happy hour with good drinks and a DJ.
476	0	This hotel was chosen for it's price tag. But I would NEVER GO BACK AGAIN!!!  I would rather sleep in a rental car.  The hotel is very run down. Maintenance is in over their heads and housekeeping seems to overlook even the most obvious details of cleaning a room.  In order to open the jammed door to our room, you had to lift up and push. The door had broken pieces and dents near the door knob, which makes me believe someone attempted to break into that room at one point. Management apparently doesn't deem this a necessary fix. The bathtub was filthy... Nothing a good scrubbing couldn't fix, but it had a ring around it... As if housekeeping repeatedly bypassed scrubbing the bathtub. It's the first bathroom I refused to use due to uncleanliness. The floor was sticky like it had been mopped with a dirty mop, so I chose to keep my shoes on. My "non-smoking" room was DEFINITELY smoked in and it smelled moist and musky.  The TV didn't work, but maintenance came and brought us a new cable to get it working again. Someone had stolen the cable to the TV. The walls are thin. BUT THE VERY WORST PART: My partner woke up in the middle of the night with a sudden breakout/reaction on both of his eyes.  The DIRTY BEDDING caused this. We left immediately and did not even finish our nights stay. After leaving it cleared up very quickly. He hadn't suffered from a reaction like that since he was a child. But because of past experience, he knew it was an allergic reaction to all the dust and smoke in the room. We were offered another room but not a refund.  I recommend going next door to the Howard Johnson on Tropicana!!!  The rooms are dated but ALWAYS clean and never smell like smoke!!! Not to mention, the price tag is also cheap so you have more money for other things!
1401	0	Yikes. We came here for breakfast one morning and man did we regret it. The worst service I've ever experienced and the worst food. Everything was very greasy... Actually, greasy is the wrong word... It was oily. Very oily. Ew.   We had basic eggs, bacon, toast and hashbrowns which I thought was hard to screw up but somehow they went above and beyond. Took an entire napkin to soak up the oil from my easy over eggs. My friend had the scrambled eggs which were clearly scooped from a bucket of pre-made, and gooey, eggs. Makes me shudder to think of it.  The service was brutal. She forgot to bring us knives and forks, then forgot salt and pepper, and the ketchup and then she sat in the corner giggling with the rest of the staff until we finally asked someone else. What a joke.  Avoid at all costs.
1268	1	Went there for the first time, tonight, with a friend. In a word, awesome! Had the number 55, which was beef and I think Cilantro and some other stuff I can't remember, but it was amazing. Had the yellow curry with chicken as well, both dishes done to a number 2 out of 10 heat level. I'd been told they really crank up the heat and so we went for a low number. Turns out I could have gone up several notches with that, but even at level 2 there was definitely some spice and flavor.   Anyway, great food, friendly and prompt service, and I will absolutely be going there again.
1555	1	Amazing food and amazing service. My sister and I came here for breakfast on a Thursday morning and it was totally empty. We were seated immediately and I ordered their sourdough waffles while my sister got their American breakfast with their chocolate almond croissant.   I loved my waffles. They were crispy yet chewy. My sister enjoyed her American breakfast, but she absolutely loved their chocolate almond croissant, which was pretty amazing. We later ended up going to the bouchon bakery to get another one.   Service was impeccable, everyone was beyond friendly! I will definitely come by again the next time I'm in Vegas.
159	1	This was a positively sublime burger-eating experience.  When in town for a weekend, this was the one place I wanted to make sure I stopped by, and I wasn't disappointed.  Buddy and I each ordered the kobe beef burger and couldn't have been happier.  The meat was prepared perfectly, and the list of available toppings was extensive.  I love that the toppings went from mild to wild and cheap to expensive.  This is probably the only place where one could get a burger with both shaved truffle slices and velveeta.  I went with carmelized onions and gorgonzola - delicious!  As others have said, you must try the sweet potato fries.  They are well worth the extra expense and are scrumptious.  One last piece of advice - do the call-ahead seating.  The restaurant doesn't do reservations, but you can call ahead up to a half hour.  My buddy and I did this and were able to walk right in upon arrival.  The place was packed, and the relatively huge line that formed behind us didn't care for us all that much.  In the end, the price was more than reasonable, given how well-prepared and customizable the meal is.  There may be a better burger somewhere else, but I certainly have yet to find it.
1306	0	I had been there before years back. Great location , live country music something different , but the food was too bad to give it more than 2 stars. Service was quick and friendly but what they served was awful . Seemed like everything was old and flavorless. Like it was sitting around for hours before serving  even the baked beans made canned super market beans seem gourmet . Dried out ribs, something that was supposed to be steak and seafood that was a war crime . Pass on this place and enjoy many of the other fine places in town. They clearly don't care
904	1	We Americans are a funny group...don't mess with our country or our burgers! East Coast VS West Coast, gosh how did it come to this? The burger bar is set so high nowadays with each new burger joint trying to out do the other. Enjoying a burger is so subjective, it really is all about what you personally like. Its sort of similar to whether you like your margarita with or without salt, there is no right or wrong answer here people!    I personally am a burger purist and I don't like anything other than the old fashioned Cheeseburger with LTO. Well Shake Shack has officially turned me around. A burger thats topped with a Cheese Stuffed Portobello Mushroom?! WTH?! Just the sound of that makes me cringe but I knew this place came with high accolades so I took a chance and since that fateful day I have never ordered anything but the Shack Stack here. Its juicy, flavorful and it oozes...CHEESE! How fun is oozing cheese you ask? FREAKING FUN! Every bite I was amazed at how enjoyable this burger was and I honestly haven't been this excited for a burger in a long, long time. The saying.. "Party In My Mouth" is fitting here. TRY THIS BURGER!  When I first saw the fries I admit I started getting anxious and questioned this decision to walk through NY NY Casino for a burger with Sysco fries. Upon first glance I saw they are the type of fries I was served in school, you know those crinkled and soggy cardboard things the National School Lunch Program passed off as food? Well thankfully they were nothing like the sad sack of fries I was served in high school. These were perfectly and evenly crisped on all sides of the fry. I started chomping away in amazement on how they were able to achieve such an even crisp on all sides of a crinkle cut fry. How did they do it? nom nom...Why has it not been done before? nom nom nom.. This is amazing! I can't believe I'm going to say this... but I like crinkle cut fries now.  We also have enjoyed some of their shakes but my favorite will always be the black and white shake. I think thats where the east coast thing comes in.. I have never had a decent one here in town. Not sure why.. I usually get a puzzled stare when I have ordered one in the past but at Shake Shack I don't have to feel like an weirdo, I fit right in.   Shake Shack is by far the most talked about burger as of late in a city full of burger joints.  And Shake Shack is definitely a place that will stick around. I recommend going there.. Its that good!
1834	0	We went here to order breakfast at around 6am on a Sunday morning. Unfortunately we didn't even get that far. The waitress who was assigned to our table refused to take our orders because a "new shift" was starting even though we had been waiting for 20 minutes. We talked to the hostess and all she did was tell us which waitress was assigned to our table, the one who still refused to take our order. Given this terrible service we left. Needless to say, we won't be coming back.
227	0	I went to lunch around 3pm with no line. Awesome right? Anyways the food was ok. Decent. Better than hometown imo but my gripe is the staff. My server sucks. Never once did she ask if I wanted a refill on my drink and my plates were stacked 4 high...  I had to complain to the floor manager Anthony. He apologized but still the lack of professionalism had caused me to have an awful experience. Don't know if I would go back.  If I do it would ve because of the floor manager
192	1	Mouth. Watering. Pizza.   I can't tell you how good this pizza is. It's a great combination of salty and cheesy goodness. I always get either a slice of their mushroom pizza or white pizza. Their mushroom pizza is delicious + a little bit of added chili flakes makes the saltiness of the pizza all come together for a flavorful bite. Their white pizza is probably one of their more famous pies and with good reason, it's delicious! It's a mozzarella (and parmesan?) based slice topped with ricotta cheese. At first, I thought it would be too much cheese for my liking but it all somehow comes together as cheesy goodness.  Now, the crust...it's all about the crust!! The pizza itself is thin with a slight crunchy bite to it. The crust is crispy but with a doughy inside that I love. The slices run pretty big so it's worth the price! ($5/6) Usually all it takes is one slice for me to be done, two if I'm super hungry. I've never had to wait in a long line to place my order (my wait is usually like 5 mins) but I've been told it can get pretty crazy late night when the clubs close.  My only complaint about the pizza is that it can be a little too oily. Seeing small puddles of greasiness is kind of gross, but nothing a pat down with a napkin won't fix. Just wish I didn't have to perform this messy task before eating it.   Seating is available inside (best for parties of 2, not so much for bigger parties) & all around the lounge type area but it can be difficult to find an open space during a busy night. The pizzeria itself is located on the 3rd floor of Cosmo, down a hallway across from the escalators.
897	0	No.  Obviously you don't have very high expectations when going to a place like this.. it's basically a glorified bar.. and this location is on the Las Vegas Strip...and to basically mimic what another reviewer said: the service was sloooow - and the food was GROSS.   I ordered a 'chicken fajita burrito'.. which came to he table as a 'BEEF fajita burrito'.. about 35 minutes after it was ordered..AND it had CHILI all over it... like beef chili.. slopped over the top.. along with fake canned cheese.. which I guess would be fine, if that is what I had ordered.. and i was extremely drunk.  It was incorrect.. it looked unappealing.. but hey, I gave it a chance. Sufficed to say, I won't be going back for that particular menu item. (I did mention to the server that it was incorrect... he claimed they sent the wrong one, and I said I would deal with it.. but on the bill, it was listed as BEEF Fajita Burrito..as in.. he ordered the wrong item and lied to me about it.) Mistakes happen.. I get it... I'm just sayin.  The 2 friends I was with, both decided it was pretty bad service as there were missing utensils, drinks for the 3 of us were coming one at a time.. and there really seemed to be no excuse for the lack in service, because they were not at all busy.   We all agreed that the drinks weren't bad.. and the outdoor patio is a nice attraction to ''people watch' from .. but other than that.. I will not be eating any of their "signature" dishes again...ever. They had chicken tenders with fries on the menu, and if I ever visit this spot again to have drinks.. and decide that I am hungry (and very lazy, because there are 10 better choices less than 50 feet away, ) I will be having those.   I don't recommend the food at all. The drinks were good and the Jeremiah Sweet Tea Vodka(?) Drink.. was tasty albeit very  sweet... but I did have 2! Anyway.. that's that.. good luck in your dining adventures!
1130	0	One word - horrible!!!!    But I should start on a positive. The salad was neat. They make it for you. But have weird asst of fixings and way too much salad dressing. They did have a grilled cauliflower that was yummy. And the pizza was great but not worth $30. Nathan said the prime rib and ribs were yummy and went back for seconds. Of course his last meal was chicken nuggets at noon at the airport.   Honestly there was no food here that I liked. The soups are weird colors and look canned and sitting way too long. The sushi was horrible. Dried out. Don't make so much if folks aren't eating it. The pot stickers were greasy. The vegetable spring roll was mostly roll with a few slivers of cabbage and on of carrot.  The potato augratin which is usually hard to pass up couldn't be cut up with a fork.  Overall YUCK!!!

1640	0	Perhaps I can't write a completely accurate review because I was sharing a hot dog and hamburger with a lame person who only wanted grilled onions on the dog and sauteed mushrooms on the burger  (seriously?? no effing beef chili, no cheese, no nothing!?  jesus).  But just based off the actual hot dog and hamburger, they weren't great. The hot dog wasn't the juicy, thick tube of meat I was anticipating.  Instead, it was a thin, dry, floppy thing that looked like one of those balloons you tie into animals.    The hamburger wasn't much better - pretty overcooked.  The fries, however, were decent - crispy, fresh and hot.  I didn't get the onion rings, but they looked like they could have been pretty good too.
414	0	Old, old, old, and too far down the strip.  I stayed here to go on the cheap.  Not next time.  They really ticked me off the last day.  First, they tacked on an energy surcharge when I checked out.  Is this something required by law of all the hotels now?  This did not happen before.  If it is not law, it is crap!  They should have just added it into the price of their crappy rooms!  To top it off, we went the night before to print out our boarding passes.  they guy at the desk said he couldn't help us, even though he was just chatting up his co-worker.  He told me I could either use my credit card for the machine in the lobby or to go to the business center in the morning.  Assuming it was free (remember, my friends, what it means to assume!) we walked allllllllll the way across the hotel to be informed that there was a dollar a minute charge to use the internet and a 50 cent fee for each sheet of paper we printed off, even though we were guests of the hotel.  What if their internet was as slow as their hotel is old?  It would have cost us a lot for a dollar a minute!  What a load of crap!  I realized then how far away I was from the Bellagio...  One star because they are next to the Peppermill, one of the best places for breakfast in Vegas!!!

We had our first date here and every year we return to re-enact that beautiful evening.   Our favorites:   Crispy Rice (vegetarian style) -- truly amazing flavor, we could eat this all night. It actually paired very well with the  Papaya Salad (vegetarian version) -- delicious! Our only disappointment this most recent visit is we asked for Medium spicy and it was completely mild.   Mangoes & Sticky Rice -- luscious perfection! Never disappoints. I've been experimenting with making my own but they really have it down. The crunchy fried mung beans on top are a crispy balance to the chewy rice and ripe mango, and I have no idea how to replicate those at home!   I understand there are some low reviews from tourists visiting Vegas who may have had an uneven experience and felt disappointed, but as residents of Vegas who have dined here many times as well as at all the other Thai offerings in town, this place is the deal. If you had a less than spectacular time, try again. It is so worth it!   And yes . . . the parking lot is a little sketchy sometimes, but this has no bearing on my tastebuds. Go with a friend!
469	0	We were staying at Mandalay Bay on 9/18 and decided to try the breakfast buffet. I wish I would have checked Yelp first! The service was nice, but the food was horrible! I tried some cold tater tots, stale pancakes with blueberry filling, greasy french toast sticks and fruit. The fruit was the only edible item on the buffet.
1260	0	Great food. The service is extremely slow. Nothing happens fast here. 10 minutes to get a drink from when I sat down. The meat servers do not come around often if you sit on the patio. Servers are not motivated to earn tips. 35 minutes to the pay ythe bill. So many better places to go
1980	0	This buffet is very overpriced especially considering the quality of the food.  Most of the food is average and the rest is below average.  For the price it is more worth it to spend a few extra bucks and go to Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Place or The Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan.  5/10 for food, 2/10 for price, 7/10 for staff (some were friendly while others were kinda rude).  Overall, this buffet is not worth going to and there are far better buffets walking distance away that you can go to.
1913	1	I'm back home in Cali and I already want to go back to Vegas just so I can eat here again!  I saw the Ox-Tail Fries on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives and I craved it so bad.  It was really good.  The fried egg on top just made it even better.  The ox tail meat was savory and soft, melt in your mouth.  I tried the Ronin Burger, which is the most popular but I didn't really like it.  There was too much carmelized onions which I usually love but it made the burger too sweet.  My husband had the Miyagi-san's Wagyu Burger and it was so awesome!!  I ate half of his burger.  It was really savory and just good.  I wanted to try their Boba drinks but I was too full after.  I can't wait to go back again!
1598	0	When I visited Las Vegas last week I stayed at the Harrah's Hotel and Casino and figured that I would try the buffet. Big mistake I ended up spending over 70 bucks for me in my husband and the food was mediocre not flavored the only thing that was good was the ice cream won't be coming back here when I come back to Vegas
843	1	Ill keep it short and simple!   Food = AMAZING.  -I am not the easiest to please, but paying upwards of $20 a burger is not on my usual budget for dinner. So, for the price, I was very pleased!  Service = GOOD  Could be a little better. Though they were renovating at the time of our visit so I wont ding them  Atmosphere = OK/GOOD  A little bland for the price. But Id rather pay for the food and not the art on the walls!   I will deff recommend this place and keep going back. Great good!!!!
1060	1	Went here for the first time and it was great!  Dining experience - 5/5 I mean it's KBBQ/Yakiniku style so you cook everything yourself which is always fun and awesome because you can control how you want your beef/steak done   Taste- 5/5 they have a variety of meats/seafood/vegetables you could throw on the grill including Kobe style beef which just melts in your mouth  Cost-4/5 not bad the only pricey item was the Kobe style beef which is ok, could be a little cheaper (comes with 5-6 slices=$21.95) they also catch you on the little things you'd expect to be included with your meal (sauces, rice, etc. they do come with complimentary small side dishes like kimchi, mac salad, etc.)   All in all it was great! Also if you were to write a Yelp review you get a free desert!
1368	0	Every time I drove by the Caesar's Palace I would see the serendipity restaurant and I've always wanted to go there  I finally went it was a huge turn off I wanted to sit outside and I understood there was a 25 minute wait we sat outside on the tables the tables were dirty our waiter Who had a full beard was really rude we didn't even get napkins with silverware we ordered what we wanted my husband ordered a beer and the waiter was just very rude we felt rushed to order when my husband got the beer it wasn't even that cold another waiter walked by and we had to ask for napkins and silverware because the other one that was assigned to us didn't even provide it honestly it was a huge turnoff I won't go back I had high expectations  For a restaurant that is in a very nice casino I think it just wasn't what I expected the place was very dirty one of the waiters picked up a plate from the table across from us I believe she got something on her finger and she licked her finger that was very unprofessional perhaps the people there should pay attention to detail and be nicer and clean up
947	0	Enjoy the feeling of being packed like a can of sardines?  Have enough free time to wait in lines even after getting in?  Feel like bumping shoulders, elbows, while on the dance floor?  Like short bouncers with a Napolean complex?  Great!  This is the place for you then!  Pay an extravagant cover fee for the experience!  Thank goodness I didn't wait in the hour+ line and got in right away through hookups, otherwise it would've made the experience all the worst.
507	1	I was introduced to this place by a friend while i lived in vegas for almost a decade. Located inside Mandalay Bay it is in their upstairs shopping area and has a great atmosphere. Service was great and booths are nice and roomy and four of us adults sat comfortably in there.  Burgers were great as were the sides and drinks. I ordered a custom made burger which does add up when you start piling on things like pineapple and different cheeses. Also added some foie gras to my burger which was delish.  The only gripe i have which i assume has nothing to do with the restaurant itself is that Yelp* has this as a $$ which i think it should be a $$$ considering there cheapest burger is in the $19 range. Other than that i have always had a great experience there and now that i live out of state Burger Bar is a must whenever i go to Las Vegas which is usually twice a year.
1642	0	Well, i think i'm one of a hand full of ladies who actually like hooters restaurants.  so my boyfriend took myself and another couple here for my birthday dinner , one of my 4 night stay in vegas (@ treasure island) we also wanted to see there casino.. not that impressed anyway.. The food was okay, the service was awful, of all the hooters i've been to this is the worst by far. And you'd think its be the BEST since its in there hotel/casino.. not the case.
1650	0	I was severely disappointed in the food and service at Pampas.  This sort of sums it up: the lousy Margherita that I ordered as soon as we sat down did not come until we were almost done with the over cooked dinner.    Surprise!  The salad bar has a nice selection of items. This creates a false sense of what the meal will be like.   But reality set in when the waiters started to serve the rodizio meats on the skewers. Only one item was medium rare, the sirloin steak.  Other than that, the chicken, sausage, lamb, pork, filet mignon ( a crime to ruin a good cut on beef), ham and other unrecognizable rats were over cooked, dry and tough.  Shoe leather would be more tender.   Wait I am almost done and my Margherita finally arrived. I really need a drink to digest this food. I take a sip and wait, when did 7-11 start making Margherita icee's?  The drink was all crushed ice very little drink. I guess it is a fitting cocktail.      Oh no. The bill just came. They put different tip suggestions based on different percentages.  So the bill was $102 and the 20% tip is $33.40?  What type of math are they using???   On top of everything, Pampas is expensive.  $70 per person.  Save yourself some money and go to a Mc Donald's .
580	0	It was the third day away from NYC food in combination of eating Vegas style steak+eggs-ish meals .... Noodles really hit the spot, even at $15 a small bowl of noodle soup (which would easily cost $3.75 in NYC chinatown).  The food here isn't your typical Americanized chinese take-out.  Believe me, there is NO SUCH THING as sweet & sour pork or general tso's chicken in real chinese cuisine....  Noodles is on par in terms of taste.  If a restaurant can make money, have customers return, and write good reviews by serving food with 800% mark-up, bravo to you, seriously.  And for that, I refuse to give more than 2stars for such an establishment.   The only complaint I had was the bowls were rather small compare to what I'm use to (Universal order of #1 at any Viet pho restaurant.... Taiwanese noodle shops... or even Korean naengmyun noodle bowls), and they don't give you much broth.    Being that I was pretty sick of buffet foods and rich french (Vegas-style) cuisine easily price at $40+ per person, paying $15 a bowl of noodles was fulfilling.  PS - my Chinese parents would have died and hit themselves in the face with bokchoy and hot sauce if they knew I spent $50+ for a bowl of duck noodle soup, chicken congee, and roti canai.  Seriously, yo.
200	0	This place was horrible !!!   Please never go there It is a scam!! Overpriced and server Rio was extremely rude when I questioned about our receipt! He overcharged us, I came here with my family to enjoy spring break and made this awful choice to come here !!! Will never forgive myself for wasting money on this disgusting place
514	1	Loved BurGR! My husband visited on our most recent Vegas trip, and we were very pleased. My hubby got the mushroom burger I don't remember the name but he loved it. And I had the hog burger, which was juicy and had a really good smokey pork flavor. My all time favorite though were the truffle fries and homemade ketchup and garlic aoli sauces. They are very addicting!   The atmosphere is clean and organized here, and the wait staff were great. We say right in front of the cool fire display.  I regret not trying the milkshakes, they looked really good. I will have to visit again and order one next time!
587	1	I live in Henderson, so this review is from a local.  I looked up what time they opened so I could be first in line for a take out for our lunch order. Looked up the distance and time so as to arrive around 15 minutes early. So I'm standing there and a bmw pulls up and sits right there in front of the entrance and of course leaves their engine on to run the a/c as it's around 100F out. The fumes started to bug me so when I saw one of the employees I knocked on the glass door and asked to sit inside (even though they weren't open yet) and he immediately let me in around 10 minutes early! One star.  I sat and people started coming in before anyone was seated, and I didn't feel like standing just to be first. When they started seating, the guy said ok, who's first (second star) and I stood, walked past the other people and said I'd like to make a take out order.  I just got two cheeseburgers and an order of fries. He asked me if I wanted L / T / O (lettuce, tomatoes, onions) and I said yes, how would you like them cooked? One well done, one medium. I forgot to tell them to burn my fries - I like them really crunchy. Oh well, next time.  The order took around 15 minutes or so (third star). The fourth and fifth star was for the first bite of my bachi burger. The bun is thin, so you don't have to unhinge your jaw to get a full bite. The burger is just tasty and juicy and I got l / t / o with every bite. Fries were good (crunchy next time!). For the fries, I'm in love with their pineapple ketchup. And they marked one well done!  Location: right off the 215, a couple cross streets down Windmill.  Total was $24 with change.

They moved me to a new hotel room, but did not refund my cost of staying there, and I am STILL trying to get compensated for my dry cleaning, loss of luggage and personal items, plus measures to keep contamination from coming to my house. Then they had the audacity to tell me that they inspected the room and found it not active.   This was after their security guy took away a few bugs in a jar that I had found, after I took photos of the bites, and filled out a "report" which was actually a comment card. I've been getting the  run around from security and risk management since January 22nd. Their staff is rude and basically lied to me about this room being "non active".   Don't stay here! If you get even one bug in your luggage and take it home, it can grow into an infestation that will cost thousands to get rid of! You'll have to heat treat your home, use bug dogs, vapor strips, mattress encasements, it will put you out for their negligence! I lost my luggage, comb, a pair of shoes, etc. and am out costs because this crappy hotel is unwilling to fess up to their dirtiness!   I've given the Riviera up until now to deal with this problem and be honest, but they refuse, so I am going to post pix here!
962	0	I spent years driving by wanting to try it. Last October I went for my birthday and I was super disappointed. White chocolate frozen hot choco was too sweet and the carrot cake sundae was mediocre. I went again last night in hopes that they were just having a bad night when I went the first time. But I was let down again. The chocolate blackout cake sundae was overwhelmingly sweet once again with no depth to the flavors what so ever. I would have gotten the same effect if I made my own at home with Hershey's chocolate sauce. When I am charged over $20 for cake and ice cream, I expect it to be pretty outstanding which Serendipity 3 just can't seem to do.
1154	1	This places is fantastic!!  Erin was our server for b'fast last Saturday and she was great!  Good prices, great food and very friendly.  We went twice over a 2 week tour of NV and CA. Would highly recommend going here to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip!
1745	0	Based on food alone this place would fail in a minute if located in Cali, east bay, or any highly populated asian community.  With that said this is vegas hence the 2 stars.      Food- food portions are small (to be expected).  This place its value orientated for asians in vegas.   Beef Noodle Soup-Not impressed; nothing special; somewhat cold when delivered Szechuan noodles and pork!-Not impressed;not spicy enough;nothing unique War Wonton Noodle Soup-HORRIBLE; no flavor, bad noodles, no flavor in dumplings.  Green Onion Pancake-HORRIBLE-your better off finding your favorite frozen brand.  Came out cold and no flavor chow fun-u can smell the wok heat, but still just ok  -=the best of the night=- Xiao Long Bao, Soup Dumplings-good flavor.  individual bao vary on attention of detail.  Sauce occasioned was spot on  either had  Seafood and Egg White Fried Rice or Fu Zhou Fried Rice, Gravy style Shrimp, Scallop, Mushrooms,Asparagus, Eggs-nice flavor.  nice and oily, but delish.     The good- Line/wait-fairly short both times under 1hour about 45 minutes.  arrived before lunch/dinner rush.  Ok- For those deprived of good authentic Chinese sure eat your heart out.  My auntie from HI thought it was good.  For those that know you got it good pass this spot up    Bad- Service-The same unattentive service you expect expect in chinatown.  Waiters need training and more discipline.  It does not look good to stand around playing on your phone or speaking overly loud where customers can hear your conversations.    Hostesses-not very host like these girls need replacing.  Do some work other than just standing up front and then ducking in the back  I came here for the hand made noodles and thus put in an order and informed only after I ordered that there were none available.  I then asked the waiter to inform me when the chef was making more so we could put in an order.  NOPE had to spot the chef making more and flag down our waiter to order.  Sure, hand tossed tasted better than store bought, but not at the price.
1217	0	Location and idea are great . Food is not all that The meat kinda lacks taste . But they have an open salad bar which has some good stuff.  Service is very slow and they refused to give us to go boxes !!! My husband was sick and didn't eat at all so I wanted to take his food to eat later , ended up going somewhere else later to eat. Definitely wouldn't go back
1921	1	*Gordon Ramsay fangirl alert*  I've been itching to try this place for a very long time, and it didn't disappoint!  I was told that the Farm Burger was the best, and after reading the description for myself and seeing that this burger involves duck bacon and a fried egg, I was sold. That was one darn good burger!  We didn't get any fries, and instead opted for the milkshake. NO REGRETS! (and I love me some fries...)  The creme brulee milkshake was heavenly! We also got the Oreo and Banana Shakes... they were both good, but my favorite, hands down, is the Creme Brulee milkshake! Get it, you won't regret it!  So switch out the fries for shakes, if you need to make a choice.  Service was great. Our server was cool, but I don't understand why they just leave their iPad menus on the table after taking an order. It was a little stressful with a toddler at the table, because we were afraid he would order something accidentally.  Aside from that, all was good! I would love to come back!
522	0	Mediocre at best.  The salad was generously sized but boring. My friend had a decent burger with OK fries. Two of us got a $15 glass of wine that was minuscule. They should cut back on the portions of their bland food and pour an average glass of wine.
